In 2007, Twilio launched as a groundbreaking API-as-a-product platform, introducing a voice API that enabled developers to make and receive phone calls through any cloud application. Over the next few years, Twilio expanded its offerings by releasing a text messaging API and an SMS short code API, cementing its role as a critical telephony resource in developers' toolkits.

Twilio is widely regarded as a model platform for engaging and evangelizing developers. It has helped define the technical and business building blocks essential for a successful API-driven platform. Twilio set a high standard for developer outreach through its presence at events, hackathons, and online communities, while actively showcasing, supporting, and investing in its developer ecosystem.

Alongside platforms like Foursquare and Instagram, Twilio has become a defining force in mobile application development, helping push APIs into the mainstream. While platforms like Twitter have sometimes been cited as cautionary tales in API strategy, Twilio has proven that API-driven ecosystems can thrive when executed thoughtfully.

By 2011, the bar for delivering APIs via HTTP had already been set by early pioneers like Salesforce and Amazon. However, Twilio demonstrated how APIs could evolve into mature, developer-friendly products in the mobile era. That evolution, while modern, owes much to the foundations laid by commerce, social, and cloud API pioneers.
