There are many people involved with API change within the enterprise, but there is a classic persona of who knocks on the API Evangelist door or is recommended by someone who is familiar with what API Evangelist does and brings them to our door to have a conversation about property governing their enterprise API operations.

  - CTO or CIO or CDO
  - Product Owner
  - Digital Transformation
  - Leading Innovation
  - Driving Change

These individuals are often new to a company and looking to make change, or they have been there a long time and have hit the wall when it comes to taming the digital transformation and API chaos that exists across API operations, looking to do something about it, but doesnâ€™t always know where they should begin.
