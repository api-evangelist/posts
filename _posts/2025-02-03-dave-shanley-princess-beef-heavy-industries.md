Quobix from from Princess Beef Heavy Industries came by again, this time to talk about [OpenAPI Doctor](https://bit.ly/3UTwuOF) and [libopenapi](https://bit.ly/4hAxBf2) at it's core. I knew "The Doctor" was a modular OpenAPI editor w/ governance built-in, but I didn't realize how deeply modularity is baked into it's design. This modularity allows Quobix to stitch together Vacuum, libopenapi, OpenAPI changes, wiretap, and other Princess Beef Heavy Industries solutions, but also potentially other 3rd party solutions. This modularity in API hubs, dashboards, and tools is becoming a common themes in conversations that I am having, and something I am going to work to leverage more as part of my work. This episode went 30 minutes because I wanted to do two separate episoides, 1) OpenAPI, 2) libopenapi, but the stories are so entertwhined we just did it back to back.

We spent most of this discussion on the technical bits, but I know that the business and politics of the decisions, licensing, and modularity are where Quobix's approach is going to dominate the conversation. Having your API governance baked into your OpenAPI is important, but having any other piece of the puzzle in there as well will drive adoption. I am confident that enterprises are going to get more particular about what services and tools they bake into their operations. After several gateway hangovers, now API client hangovers, modularity coupled with spec and git driven process are going to dominate. I am going to get more acquainted with the code base behind "The Doctor". I am not a fluent Go developers, but I am not afraid to get under the and reverse engineer what is going on. Next, I am going back through my notes and transcript from our conversation and pull out a couple more stories, but also plant some seeds for more discussion with Quobix down the road.
