I will be doing a webinar with Chris Haddad ([@cobiacomm](https://twitter.com/cobiacomm)) of [WSO2](http://wso2.com/ "WSO2") on October 9th, where we discuss [API management best practices for digital business ecosystem](http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value/ "API management best practices for digital business ecosystem").

WSO2 is one of my partner API server providers. I’m a big supporter of what they do because they were the first open source API service provider to emerge out of the [20 API service providers](http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/ "20 API Service Providers") in the space.

Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:

*   Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems
*   How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API
*   When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value
*   Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs

WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris. The webinar titled "[WSO2 Case Study – API Management Building Blocks and Business Value](http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value "WSO2 Case Study – API Management Building Blocks and Business Value")", will be on Tuesday, October 9, at 9:00 a.m. – 10:00 a.m. PDT.

Look forward to having you there, visit [WSO2 for more information](http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value).
