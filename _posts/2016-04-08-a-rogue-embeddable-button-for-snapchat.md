I see quite a few rogue APIs, and often rogue SDKs, but this is the first time I've come across a rogue embeddable button. While browsing Product Hunt this morning I came across this [rogue Snapchat embeddable button](https://scbutton.com/), which allows you to promote your Snapchat account on any website.

It just makes me sad that platforms don't just ignore platform fans and advocates like this, but actively work to lock things down to prevent this kind of serendipity from happening. Why would you want to shut down people who are looking to promote your tool? You should be enabling them.

If Snapchat had a proper API portal, they would take this signal, internalize it, and turn it into an official set of embeddable tools for the messaging platform. #derp
