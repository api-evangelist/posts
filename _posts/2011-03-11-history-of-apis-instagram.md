On October 6, 2010, Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone application. Less than three months later, it had attracted one million users. Kevin Systrom, the founder of Instagram, focused on delivering a powerful yet simple iPhone app that addressed common issues with mobile photo quality and users' frustrations with sharing.

Despite its early success, many users quickly voiced complaints about the lack of a central Instagram website or an API. However, Instagram remained committed to prioritizing its core iPhone application. In December, a developer named Mislav Marohnić took matters into his own hands. He reverse-engineered the iPhone app’s functionality and built an unofficial Instagram API.

By January, Instagram shut down the rogue API and announced plans to develop an official one. Just a month later, in February 2011, Instagram released its official API for the platform. Within days, numerous photo applications, photo-sharing sites, and mashups built around the API began to emerge. Instagram started as a viral iPhone app sensation but quickly recognized the need for an API to unlock its full potential.
