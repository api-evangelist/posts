Greg Dennis who was on my team at Postman, and part of my master plan to spend as much VC money as I could on open source API technology, came by to share his expert view on the diff between HTTP APIs and programming language library APIs. Greg is one of the caring souls who are tending to the JSON Schema specification, and has extensive experience developing and maintaining his .NET JSON Schema library--json-everything. Greg is learning more about HTTP API design these days, but I find his view of the art of programming language library API maintenance important, and something that helps expand, color, and shape my views as an HTTP API craftsperson.

I am thankful that people like Greg exist to help maintain important open source specifications and libraries like [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) and [json-everything](https://json-everything.net/). I don't have the patience--my open source projects are more of a dictatorship with a liberal license. It was enjoyable to explore the surface area of programming language library APIs like Greg maintains versus the HTTP APIs I immerse myself in each day. I think I'd like to go explore all the different types of APIs out there, just to help better define my positioning around HTTP APIs. I appreciate the conversation Greg, and look forward to having you back to talk JSON Schema and dive into each of the tools in the json-everything toolbox.
