Nike is working on a new API as part of their [Nike Better World initative](http://www.nikebetterworld.com/ "Nike Better World initative"). The [API provides access to a materials sustainability index](http://nikemsiapi.nikebetterworld.com/ "API provides access to a materials sustainability index"), which evaluates the environmental impact of materials used by manufacturers.

The scoring system evaluates the environmental impacts of materials used in products using a combination of materials-specific data, covering areas such as Chemistry, Energy and Greenhouse Gas Intensity, Water and Land Use Intensity, and Waste.

The [Nike Materials Sustainability Index API](http://nikemsiapi.nikebetterworld.com/ "Nike Materials Sustainability Index API") is only in alpha stage right now, and is undergoing for a peer review process with Duke University. You can follow their [Nike Makerâ€™s Blog](http://nikemakers.tumblr.com/ "Nike Makers Blog") to get more information on the initiative and get notified when the API will be available to the public.
