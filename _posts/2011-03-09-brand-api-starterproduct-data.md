I have been thinking about[Adam Kleinbergs](http://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkleinberg "Adam Kleinberg") recent posts,[Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers](http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/brand-open-api-developers/ "Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers") and[Digging deeper on Brand APIs](http://www.tractionco.com/blog/63-digging-deeper-on-brand-apis "Digging Deeper on Brand APIs").

He's right. The pace of API development skyrocketed in 2010, and will continue in 2011.

Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.

Where does a company start? Start with what you know. Your products.

Make your product data available via a [RESTful](http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/) API. Provide the basics: Names, Descriptions, and Images.

Allow developers to sign up, and register for a key.

Provide simple documentation describing how to make calls against your API, sample code in PHP, Ruby, and Python.

Setup an [FAQ page](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=132 "FAQ"), [blog](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=123 "Blog"), [forum](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=131 "Forum"), and support contact form.

Establish a clear [terms and conditions](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=150 "Terms and Conditions") page, with clear [brand guidelines](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=149 "Brand Guidelines") regarding how users can use your product data.

Brands should start simple, start with delivering basic information about your products through a RESTful API.

You never know what you'll learn!
