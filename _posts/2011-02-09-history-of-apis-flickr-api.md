In February 2004, the popular photo-sharing site Flickr was launched. Six months later, they introduced their now-famous API, and within another six months, Yahoo acquired the platform. Originally designed as an online game, Flickr quickly transformed into a social photo-sharing sensation, powering much of the early waves of blogging on the web.

The release of Flickr's RESTful API played a pivotal role in its rise, enabling users to seamlessly embed photos into blogs and social media streams. This innovation established Flickr as the go-to image platform for the early blogging and social media movement. Flickr's API also inspired the concept of BizDev 2.0, a term coined by co-founder Caterina Fake.
