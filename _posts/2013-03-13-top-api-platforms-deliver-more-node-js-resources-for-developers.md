[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), the server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications in JavaScript, seems to be getting more attention lately from top API providers because of its event-driven, asynchronous I/O that can minimizeoverhead and maximize scalability.

Last week [Google released an official Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/#readme) that supports authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0. Then earlier this week, Amazon Web Services announced that [AWS Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS solution now supports Node.js applications](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/aws-elastic-beanstalk-for-nodejs.html).

While Google’s deployment is a client, and AWS’s is an application platform, they both have the same objective--enabling developers to build highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective applications using APIs.

Both Google and AWS recognize the potential for selling developers their valuable API driven resources, by providing them with Node.js solutions. [JavaScript is the number one language on Github](https://github.com/languages/JavaScript), with Node dominating most starred and most forked overall categories, according to Github trends.

I think that AWS and Github both send a good signal to other API owners, that they need to step up the availablity of Node.js resources for their API developer communities.
