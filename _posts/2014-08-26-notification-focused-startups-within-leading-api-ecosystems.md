I was keeping an eye out for interesting API stories on [ProductHunt](http://www.producthunt.com/) the other day and came across an cool notification startup that lives in the Stripe API ecosystem, called [Hooked](https://hooked.io/).

Hooked allows users to set up notifications for any events related to a Stripe account. Hooked uses the Stripe API to disocver events, and then employs webhooks to send notifications.

As I'm writing this story, I realize this is very similar to my [previous story today about real-time and visualization layers for APIs](http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/26/realtime-and-visualizations-will-be-key-in-financial-api-deployments/), and that notifications could easily be provided as a white label solution for API providers, giving them a ready to go notification layer to their APIs.

Right now I lump notifications in my research under [real-time](http://realtime.apievangelist.com/), but I think I will be pulling it out into its own research area. Notifications are real-time, but they are more messaging than just a real-time feature, but they are kind of more real-time than just a message too. Does that make sense?

We'll see. That is the fun of my API Evangelist research network, is that all of it is pretty liquidâ€”allowing me to keep moving things around until they make sense in my head.
