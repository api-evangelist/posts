I never properly wrapped up my experience at [API-Craft](http://api-craft.org/) last month, where I moderated a pretty important panel discussion on hypermedia with Mike Amundsen ([@mamund](http://bit.ly/1mtrwki)), Mike Kelly ([@mikekelly85](http://bit.ly/1hBxi4m)) Steve Klabnik ([@steveklabnik](http://bit.ly/1wv9KVR)), Kevin Swiber ([@kevinswiber](http://bit.ly/1oC7Udw)), Jørn Wildt ([@JornWildt](https://twitter.com/JornWildt)), and Markus Lanthaler ([@MarkusLanthaler](https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler)). 

The discussion was pretty amazing, I will let you watch for yourself. The action actually starts right at about 30:00 minute mark, so there is a lot of dead space until then.

Careful it is 3 hours of some pretty geeky talk, you might experience some hypermedia side effects. Seriously though, this is a pretty important video discussion about a very relevant, and often misunderstood part of API evolution. I highly recommend watching.

I'm just getting back down to this time period in my Evernote stack, so look for some more stories out of API Craft and hypermedia after rewatching this talk. Also stay tuned for upcoming stories from [I Love APIs in San Francisco](http://iloveapis2014.com/), [#API360 Summit in Washington DC](http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/), and of course [@APIStrat in Chicago](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php) at the end of September.
