I just got back from Madrid, Spain, where I spoke at [APIdays Mediterranea](http://mediterranea.apidays.io/). I really enjoy the API Days format, because the events are small, intimate API learning and networking opportunities.

While at API Days I got to hang out with many of the usual suspects Andy Thurai of [Intel](http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/api-management "API Management"), Guillaume Balas of [3Scale](http://3scale.net "API Management"), Ronnie Mitra of [Layer7](http://www.layer7tech.com/ "API Management"), Bruno Pedro of [CloudWork](http://cloudwork.com "CloudWork"), Swift of [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) and API Days organizer Mehdi Medjaoui of [WebShell](http://webshell.io).

I also had the opportunity to re-enforce some existing relationships in person, with Isabelle Mauny of [WSO2](http://wso2.com "API Management"), Jeremiah Lee a UX researcher from SF and Eduardo Basterrechea and Elena Alvarez of [Apicultur](http://www.apicultur.com/en/).

API Days Mediterranea was a great introduction to the API innovation occurring in Spain, and a great opportunity to have conversations with companies and developers from the region, and hear the challenges they face in getting the word out about APIs in their country.

I really dig going to new regions and helping spreading the API gospel. Thank you so much to Apicultur for bringing me out, and Webhsell and [Fabernovel](http://www.fabernovel.com/en/) for helping organize. Also don't forget 3Scale, Intel, [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/ "Email") and WSO2 for organizing.

I can't wait for the next edition of API Days, the model really works well for planting the necessary seeds in new regions to get the API conversation going. Next up is API Days San Francisco (no seed planting required), but there will be other cities added, so make sure and step up if you'd like to see API Days in your city!
