Version 4.0 API Evangelist is centered around a single narrative-—the governance of our HTTP APIs. According to Akamai, 83% of the web traffic are APIs, something Cloudflare puts at greater than 50%. Whichever you want to believe, one can easily argue that 3/4 of the traffic on the web, as well as within the enterprise is being defined and shaped by HTTP APIs. This is where API Evangelist will be focused when it comes to telling stories, producing forkable and usable artifacts, and the sale of knowledge bases and services that emphasizes the following.

- **API Surveying** - The surveying of HTTP API infrastructure, and the schema being passed back and forth between them.
- **API Assessment** -The assessing of surveyed HTTP infrastructure to identify patterns and anti-patterns in use across them.
- **API Storytelling** - Sharing of the stories accumulated by surveying and assessing APIs across many different industries.
- **API Conversations** - Talking with human beings about the experiences they have when producing or consuming APIs.

In 2025, there are plenty of things to distract your organization from doing the hard work that is in front of you, allowing you to rapidly produce tomorrows tech debt. API Evangelist will be your partner in identifying and tackling what the real work is on the table, and assist you in standing up the API platform and publish API presence that will set your enterprise apart from others in your industry. API Evangelist will be surveying and assessing the public API landscape, telling stories and having conversations out in the open about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to API operations--this round is all about demonstrating how to govern, guide, and lead your enterprise as part of the wider API conversation.
