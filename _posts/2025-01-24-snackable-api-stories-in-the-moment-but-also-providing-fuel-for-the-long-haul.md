API Evangelist is perpetually stuck in between the strategic and tactical while crafting stories for the API space. We have heeded warnings of wise architects like [Gregor Hohpe and getting too comfortable riding the elevator up to the higher levels of operations and staying too long](https://architectelevator.com/). However, we also fully understand the dangers of the isolation and intentional separation that occurs at the lower levels of enterprise operations. Our goal is to thoughtfully swing between the ground floors and the upper levels providing snackable stories that truly help people in this moment, while also providing fuel for the long haul to get a handle on our API operations by considering the following.

- **Useful** - Providing knowledge and artifacts that are useful and practical in this very moment.
- **Positive** - Work to offer a positive view of how we can deal with large problems in front of us.
- **Hands-On** - While not always possible, whenever you can make it hands-on and executable.
- **Honest** - Offering an honest view of what is happening in this moment and how to stay afloat.
- **Snackable** - Something you want to bite into at this moment and consume as part of your day.
- **Healthy** - Won’t negatively impact long-term goals and help you build long term strength.

Our goal is to pay attention to the big picture, continue to connect as many dots as we can, while also being critical of many of the belief systems that might distract us all, by provide snackable hands-on knowledge that will make your day just a little better. We want to address questions you have right now and the challenges you are facing at this moment, while also helping keep an eye on the long-term strategy vision and practices, even if you don’t always have the time. It is tough to strike a balance between snackable and healthy, so we will be trying out many different recipes over the next couple of months, and hoping that we’ll find stories that matter in this moment, but also speak to where you are headed with your career and business.
