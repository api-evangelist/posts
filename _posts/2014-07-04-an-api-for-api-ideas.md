I have a lot of ideas while being the API Evangelist. It just comes with the territory. I have an Evernote folder that I publish these ideas to, and some of them, like my [Screen Capture API](http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/), I actually make a reality.

The other night while writing, [Shadow API: Launching An API Before Someone Else Does](http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/02/shadow-api-launching-an-api-before-someone-else-does/), I went to add the Nebraska homestead record API idea to my Evernote, and I said, ENOUGH! I need a public place to store these ideas, and while I'm at it, I'll enable others to publish ideas there too.

What better way to allow collaboration around a content store or dataset, than a Github repository plus API. So I launched [API Ideas](http://ideas.apievangelist.com/), as an individual API project, on the [API Evangelist Network](http://apievangelist.com/network.html). I allows me to retrieve, and add to a list of API ideas, all stored on Github, using a simple web API.

Iâ€™ll be evolving the API over time, you can [engage with me on the roadmap](http://ideas.apievangelist.com/roadmap.html), and see [stories around the project on the updates page](http://ideas.apievangelist.com/blog/). It is just a start, and I will be adding a lot more bells and whistles, and improve search, as I have time.
