Hey everyone. I'm heading out to the Dallas-Fort Worth area the week after next, Tuesday, May 14, to kick off the [DFW API Professionals Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/ "DFW API Professional Meetup Group").

[TheRightAPI](http://therightapi.com "TheRightAPI") team were so kind to invite me out to speak, hang out and talk APIs, to help kick-off the area API group. Both [TheRightAPI](http://therightapi.com "TheRightAPI") and backend as a service (BaaS) provider [Proxomo](http://www.proxomo.com/) are sponsoring the shindig.

The group will be meeting at the [Microsoft Campus, 7000 Texas 161, Irving, TX](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=7000+Texas+161%2C+Irving%2C+TX). We are thinking we'll kick it off with food and drinks from 6:00 - 6:45 PM, and I'll start talking around 7:00 PM.

After that we can just hang out and talk about APIs and see what all y'all are doing with APIs in Texas. Ping me if your in the DFW area, so that I know you will be there.

Look forward to seeing you there and connecting.
