One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on [itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit](https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2014/08/13/intuit-acquires-itduzzit-syncing-data-between-cloud-apps-gets-easier). Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and [reciprocity providers](http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html).

I’ve been seeing more [API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs](http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/). I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers.

The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers have the potential to reach beyond a core developer audience by:

> _The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required. With their technology combined with the range of QuickBooks platform services we already offer, the breadth and depth of integrations our partners can build will grow tremendously. itDuzzit’s sophisticated rules-based engine really set them apart from the competition, and their technology benefits the entire QuickBooks Online ecosystem: third-party developers, accountants and small businesses._

The world of accounting seems like a great place to start when providing interoperability, automation, and reciprocity tools that are not just developers, but also empower end-users to use API. If you are as advanced as Zapier, [even your reciprocity layer will have an API that developers](https://zapier.com/developer/) can put to use when taking advantage of the cross platform API integration and automation possibilities.

I will keep an eye on the [Intuit partner Platform](https://developer.intuit.com), and see what they end up doing with itDuzzit. According to the press release, "_The Intuit and itDuzzit teams are already collaborating to fold the technology into the Intuit Partner Platform”_, and hopefully we’ll see some interesting API reciprocity patterns that I can highlight here on API Evangelist, and other API providers can follow when considering their own reciprocity layer for their own platform
