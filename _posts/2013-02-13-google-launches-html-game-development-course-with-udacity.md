Google is using the [online learning platform Udacity to teach developers about game development](http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/02/udacity-html5-game-development-course.html). The new [HTML Game Development course](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255) (CS255), is the online classroom for the programming class, coupled with a series of study groups hosted at Google's San Francisco office and a contest providing developers an incentive to complete the class.

[Google is kicking off the course with a live session](https://developers.google.com/live/), with Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun on Thursday, February 14th at 10:30 AM and the class will be taught by [Colt McAnlis](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts) (Developer Advocate, Chrome Developer Relations), [Peter Lubbers](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts)(Program Manager, Chrome Developer Relations), and [Sean Bennett](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105495497383489174073/posts) (Architect, Udacity).

The HTML Game Development course from Google is an interesting approach to developer education by providing an online course bundled with in-person or streamed workshops and study groups, bundled with a contest to help motivate students.

I may create a blueprint for other API providers to follow, when launching their own courses in a similar way to Google.
