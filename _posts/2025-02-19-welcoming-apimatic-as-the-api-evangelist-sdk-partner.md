I wanted to give a big welcome to [APIMATIC as a sponsor of API Evangelist](https://bit.ly/3UFE1AP). APIMATIC and API Evangelist began working together in 2014, and [after a decade of working and storytelling together](https://apievangelist.com/2014/07/07/evolving-how-we-approach-the-api-lifecycle-with-apimatic/) I am honored to have them as an official sponsor of API Evangelist. I’ve added a mix of APIMATIC solutions to the top ticket as well as on the right menu, and will be weaving their solutions into my stories. If you know my style of partnership I won’t be writing any long glowing pieces on APIMATIC, but their offerings are woven into the fabric of the site, but also my stories-—so when I mention SDK I will reference their solutions, and mention them in my newsletter.

Generating SDKs isn’t easy across multiple programming languages and unless you have the talent on staff in each programming language, I strongly recommend talking to Adeel and team. I remember in 2014 when APIMATIC came onto the scene that John Sheehan of Runscope fame got on stage and declared SDKs were dead, and no longer needed. A decade later, APIMATIC is still generating high quality SDKs for companies, so it speaks a lot about what they offer, as well as the stories you hear across the API space about wha you will be needing as an API producer and consumer.

I am thankful to Adeel, Ameer, and team for the sponsorship, as it helps sustain the website, storytelling, knowledge builders, and now [The API Pulse](https://apievangelist.com/2025/02/19/taking-the-api-pulse-across-industries/). It is because of sponsors like APIMATIC that I am able to keep telling API stories after fifteen years of operations. SDKs are what APIMATIC is known for, but definitely take the time to look at their portal solution, their API transformer, and [I wrote about their approach to governance via their VSCode plugin](https://apievangelist.com/2024/11/14/innovation-at-intersection-of-the-ide-openapi-editor-and-governance-rules/).
