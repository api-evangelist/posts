This is a presentation hacker advocate [Abraham Williams](http://twitter.com/abraham) gave at an Apigee [API Meetup](http://www.apimeetup.com/ "API Meetup") in February meetup on the care and feeding of API champions- or as he calls them, unicorns. Thanks for sharing the video [Apigee](http://www.apigee.com "Apigee").
