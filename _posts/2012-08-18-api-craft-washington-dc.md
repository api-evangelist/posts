Continuing my API Craft road show, I landed in Washington DC for the second week in August. As I planned my trip to the nations capital, I planted the seeds for an API Craft DC version.

I chose a popular H Street watering hole, the [Queen Vic](http://www.thequeenvicdc.com/ "Queen Vic") to host the event, and in tune with [API Craft PDX](http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/ "API Craft PDX") and [API Craft SFO](/2012/08/18/api-craft-san-francisco/ "API Craft SFO") about 10-15 people showed up to drink beer and discuss APIs, DC Style.

I was impressed with not just the energy for APIs in DC, but the startup buzz occurring in a city, many like to associate with slow moving government bureaucracy. API Craft DC brought out one API Service Provider [APIphany](http://apiphany.com/ "APIphany"), and an assortment of companies that contract for the government and several other private companies including API geeks from [QVC](http://www.qvc.com/ "QVC").

API Craft DC has triggered requests for three new gatherings that I will be planning, including API Craft NYC, API Craft Philadelphia and API Craft Atlanta. Dates coming as soon as I can.
