I pulled the title for this post directly from [understanding the impact of cross-border routing of data during an era of emerging geographic restrictions](http://dyn.com/blog/which-way-does-your-data-flow/), from [Dyn](http://dyn.com/). I'm writing about this to add it to my list of numerous concerns for API providers, when it comes to internationalizing their APIs, for the global API economy--such as [establishing successful patterns for multi-lingual APIs and documentation](http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/24/successful-patterns-for-multilingual-apis-and-documentation/), or [providing API access that is replicated into multiple regions around the globe](http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/your-api-access-replicated-into-multiple-regions-around-the-globe-for-additional-charge/).

Dyn's perspective comes from a more regulatory level, which I think coming from a DNS provider is something that makes the story even more compelling. At any rate, I feel with the big data / surveillance culture that is thriving right now, regulatory concerns, when it comes to data and privacy will continue to be a natural response, and will increase, and continue to be more heavy handed. 

I am not a fan of regulation, I understand its purpose, but historically I have not been an advocate for. However there has to be a counterbalance to the bad big data behavior from tech companies, surveillance by tech companies and the government, and the increasing cyberbullshittery that is going on. I'd prefer this counter-balance be a human and people driven response, but I'm guessing it will end up being a wave of very emotional government regulatory responses, [like we seen with Safe Harbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018365.asp), and beyond.

Its my opinion that extensive logging, software defined networking, and APIs coupled with OAuth controls is how we are going to orchestrate our operations in this new, extremely volatile, land-mine ridden regulatory environment that is unfolding. This is why I keep an eye on global DNS infrastructure providers like Dyn, [as part of my DNS research](http://dns.apievangelist.com/), so that I can map out all of their API operations, and include alongside logging, SDN, and other relevant APIs--the automation of cross-border data flows using APIs, so that you can mitigate regulatory uncertainty.

I see the concept of "data flow" playing a significant role in helping use define our digital self, both individual and organizationally. Similar to [bringing into focus what online services I depend on,](http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html) and having a better handle on where my valuable digital assetts are stored, I want to know where my data flows, and have some control over it as a business or as individual. I suspect this is something that more businesses, and god help us, hopefully more individuals begin asking for, and head off some of the regulatory headwinds that are in store for all of us.
