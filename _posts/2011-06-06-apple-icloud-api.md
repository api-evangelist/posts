kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apple/apple-icloud.jpg)Lots of big news coming out of [Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/ "Apple's World Wide Developer Conference") (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.

There were major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new [iCloud](http://www.apple.com/icloud/ "iCloud").

iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for all music, photos, books, documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.

Although this line of thought is nothing new, with Apple going all in…it means the cloud has gone mainstream.

Get ready for some major growth in the cloud as Apple pushes it further, and other existing cloud providers try to compete.
