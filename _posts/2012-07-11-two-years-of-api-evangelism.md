[According to Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/online-flashmob-platform-mobber-suspended-from-twitter-api-for-promoted-trends-copycat/), Twitter suspended [Mobber](http://www.mobber.net/ "Mobber"), a platform that rewards users for distributing promoted content through their social media accounts, from using the Twitter API.

Mobber's service is obviously in direct competition with [Twitter's Promoted Trends](https://support.twitter.com/articles/282142-promoted-trends "Twitter's Promoted Trends"), part of Twitter's suite of advertising products, which also includes promoted accounts and promoted Tweets.

Of course it's Twitter's platform, they can shut off anyone's access, and easily file it under a terms of service violation. But ultimately wouldn't it make more sense if [Twitter opened it's advertising platform with APIs,](http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/29/api-driven-twitter-advertising/ "Twitter opened it's advertising platform with APIs") and allowed developers to innovate, enabling Twitter to still make money, but providing a much wider reach and audience?

Mobber's story is just another casualty in [Twitter recent efforts to take control of it's platform](/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/ "Twitter restricting developer access"), leaving developers to wonder, who is next?
