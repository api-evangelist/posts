The elite technology group at the [GSA](http://www.gsa.gov/), [known as 18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), has released the latest copy of [API guidance for federal government agencies](https://github.com/18F/api-standards) to follow when designing their own APIs.

Using 18F’s own description:

> _This document captures 18F's view of API best practices and standards. We aim to incorporate as many of them as possible into our work.  
>   
> APIs, like other web applications, will vary greatly in implementation and design, depending on the situation and the problem the application is solving._

I like the mix of info that is delivered as well:

*   High level design guidance that individual APIs interpret to meet their needs.
*   Low level web practices that most modern HTTP APIs use.

To top it off, [the API Standards is hosted on Github](https://github.com/18F/api-standards), in its own repository, and as Gray Brooks from 18F says:

> _"Want a formal API Standards for your agency to adopt? Fork ours, add your name to the top, and make it your own."_

Simple guidance like this goes a long way in helping, sometimes even very experienced developers, understand the best practices when it comes to designing, simple, modern APIs—a world where consistency and simplicity goes a long way!
