[3Scale](http://www.3scale.net/ "3Scale") provides scalable API Infrastructure as a Service to control, manage and monetize the distribution of data, content or services for devices, mobile and web applications.

The [3Scale Billing API](http://www.3scale.net/support/billing-api/ "3Scale Billing API") provides access to 3Scaleâ€™s billing features to enable you to access invoices, line items and payment information for each of your API users, enabling integration into your own internal systems.

The 3Scale Billing API provides a RESTful API, using a key for authentication, and responses in an XML format.

3Scale provides a freemium account with 50K calls per day, and other packages for higher volume calls. The billing and pricing module needed for this API requires an additional add-on package starting at $59 a month.

The [3Scale Billing API](http://www.3scale.net/support/billing-api/ "3Scale Billing API") for API billing and monetization is a perfect tool for the API Stack.
