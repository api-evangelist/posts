A group of innovators called [BlablabLAB](http://www.facebook.com/pages/blablabLAB/204092786276896?sk=wall "BlablabLAB") have integrated a Kinect with a 3-D printer to print personalized statues.

BlablabLAB setup an interactive art installation on the streets of Barcelona, which allows users to stand in a structure surrounded by three Kinect sensors.

The sensors capture a 360-degree video of the person, then sends details to a low-resolution 3-D printer, which spits out a small thermoplastic figurine.

You can watch a video on the [BlablabLAB project over at Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/21676294 "BlablabLAB").

Its a pretty cool low cost, high tech approach to personalized printing.
