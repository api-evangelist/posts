I’ve been tracking the [adoption of the White House CIO's digital strategy](/federal_government.php "progress of each federal agency’s adoption of the White House CIO digital strategy"), trying understand each agency's mobile and API plans.

Today I noticed that NASA, in addition to publishing their digital strategy in [HTML](http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html "NASA HTML Digital Strategy"), [XML](http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.xml "XML") and [JSON](http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.json "NASA JSON Digital Strategy"), added a "recent commits" Github widget on their digital strategy homepage.

It’s a small, but very important addition. It shows that NASA sees the importance of not just using Github, but pushing code and interacting with developers via the social network.

[Github](http://www.github.com "Github") is a service that is getting more traction within government, and I hope that more federal agencies don’t just put it to use, but make it part of the culture within their organization.

Github is more than a code repository, it will also help your agency be more "**collaborative and open by default**".
