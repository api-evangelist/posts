[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/stack-overflow/Stack-Apps-Registration.png)](http://www.stackapps.com)You want to make it as easy as possible for developers to get up and running with your [API](http://www.apievangelist.com/).

You don't want developers to fumble around with lengthy registrations and approval processes.

Your API registration needs to be simple and self-service. [OpenID](http://openid.net) is one way to do this.

[StackApps](http://stackapps.com), the [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) API demonstrates this perfectly.

I wanted to see what was possible using the Stack Apps API. My objective is to integrate an API FAQ system with a Stack Overflow site.

I went to Stack Apps and clicked on registration. Stack Apps only gives OpenID for registration. They allow you to select from top providers like [Google](http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/) and [Facebook](http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/) or use your own OpenID provider.

With two clicks I was registered for a Stack Apps developer account, and with one more click I was registering my [Application](http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/) and getting my keys.

This is how easy you want to make it for developers to get up and going developing against your API. OpenID is the solution.
