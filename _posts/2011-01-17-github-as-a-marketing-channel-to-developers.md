Marketing products and services to developers can be difficult. They are unlike other consumers and often are difficult to reach and build trust with. [![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png)](https://github.com/) Recently, I was discussing which group within a company is most likely to initiate a plan for exposing an [API](http://www.apievangelist.com/): development, IT, Product Development, or some other? And once released who should own the API?

I advocate that all departments should have a stake in the API, and whoever owns it after release should have roots in development. Not that the development or IT department should own it, but the person in charge should have a development or IT mindset, as well as business development, product development and sales and marketing. This can be difficult to find.
