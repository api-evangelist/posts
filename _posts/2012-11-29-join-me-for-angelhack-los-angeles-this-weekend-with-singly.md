I’m going to head over to [AngelHack Los Angeles](http://angelhack.com/) this weekend (Saturday, December 1, 2012 at 9:00 AM - Sunday, December 2, 2012 at 5:00 PM) with [Singly](http://singly.com).

AngelHack Los Angeles is part of 11 city hackathon competition where winning teams will receive:

> _6-8 weeks of mentorship and be flown into Silicon Valley for a weekend of events including a Global Demo Day to A-list investors and media, Site visits to, Google, Facebook, Google Ventures, VIP dinners, and raging parties with the Valley startup community._

The hackathon is boasting over **$650,000 in prizes**. **Crazy**!

So if you are in the Los Angeles area this weekend, head over to [CrossCampus at 820 Broadway St in Santa Monica](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=Cross+Campus+820+Broadway+St+Santa+Monica,+CA+90401&fb=1&gl=us&hq=Cross+Campus&hnear=0x80c2a4cd0847eb0d:0xca53f623d9c85b13,820+Broadway,+Santa+Monica,+CA+90401&cid=0,0,935797429689711594&ei=5eO3UO_1Oor7igLhn4CYCA&ved=0CJoBEPwSMAE). The event kicks off 9AM saturday morning.

Get your ideas ready, and I look forward to meeting you there.
