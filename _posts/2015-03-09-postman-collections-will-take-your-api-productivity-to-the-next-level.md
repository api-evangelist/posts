If you are an API developer, it is likely you have used [Postman](http://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP), the simple tool for building, testing, and documenting your APIs. I have [Postman open as a Google Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop), which allows me to make API calls as I’m designing, developing, and integrating with the APIs across my world. Something which opens up the response and requests of API calls that I’m making, giving me more insight into how things are actually working (or not).

One of the [key aspects of Postman, are the collections](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections), which:

> _A collection lets you group individual requests together. These requests can be further organized into sub-collections/folders to completely mirror your API. Requests can also store variations and responses when saved in a collection. You can add metadata like name and description too so that all the information that a developer needs to use your API is available right where he(she) needs it. Collections are listed in the sidebar alphabetically. You can search through collection requests using the search form for quick access._

To me, Postman Collections are [API discovery](http://discovery.apievangelist.com) at the API transaction level. Allowing you to define a single unit of currency in the API economy, save, and organize them, and execute them at any point in your API lifecycle. Postman Collections measure not just an API transaction that happens, it is a measure of future transactions that can happen, complete with any relevant meta data that will be needed along the way.

Along with [Swagger](http://bitly.com/1tnYxV8), and [API Blueprint](/admin/blog/bit.ly/1arUHCU), I’m working to better understand how Postman Collections impact, and fuel the API lifecycle, including conversations with Abhinav Asthana ([@a85](https://twitter.com/a85)), Founder and CEO of Postman, about their roadmap. Postman Collections are not just about defining, organizing, and executing your API calls in the Postman client as a solo API developer, they are also about collaborating with other key players involved throughout the API lifecycle.

I’m setting up my [API Stack](http://theapistack.com) as Postman Collections, to help me understand how I can use the format to improve my API own API workflows. My goal is to ensure Postman works seamless with all stops along my own API and micro service lifecycle, from design to evangelism, and is plug and play as a machine readable element of [APIs.json](http://apisjson.org).
