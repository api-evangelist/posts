Augmenting the list of blogs that can help you learn more about APIs, a few of those blogs have newsletters, but there are also a couple of stand alone newsletters that you can tune into on a regular basis. These are the API newsletters that have their finger on the pulse of what is happening with APIs and will shift your understanding of why APIs matter.

- [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com/)
- [APIs You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/)
- [API Developer Weekly](https://apideveloperweekly.com/)
- [API Changelog](https://apichangelog.substack.com/)
- [Net API Notes](https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes)

API newsletters come and go with different cycles of investment in the API sector, but these are the newsletters that seem to sustain and are not backed by a startup selling to the API space. This is where we recommend beginning when it comes to learning more about APIs, receiving weekly drips of API knowledge in your inbox.
