One of the keys to YouTube's success as a video sharing platform is its successful API that allows developers and site owners to embed, share and distribute YouTube content across the Intertubes. ![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Youtube-Google-Code-Screenshot.PNG) As with many of its other products, Google starts with the essential API ecosystem building blocks:

*   Dashboard
*   Quickstart
*   Docs
*   Sample Code
*   Forum
*   Articles
*   Blog

In addition, YouTube really support its partner and developers with:

*   Partners Showcase
*   App Gallery
*   Widgets
*   White Label Player

Google also enforces brand integrity with a few tools:

*   Branding Guidelines
*   Compatibility
*   Terms

Google definitely has a solid formula for replicating its API ecosystems in its different products, and the [YouTube developer area](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html) is an excellent example of this formula being applied to a media API.

Like Google's other projects, YouTube utilizes [Google Code](http://code.google.com) as the repository for its API community and code.
