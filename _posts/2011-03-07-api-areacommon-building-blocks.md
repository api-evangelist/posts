I have spent time reviewing [100+ of the most popular APIs](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups "100+ Most Popular APIs"). I am trying to determine a common set of building blocks that are essential to API adoption.

Here is a list of what I consider are thkinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.comcks for API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks for API areas: ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building blocks.jpg)

*   Overview
*   Getting Started
*   API Reference / Documentation
*   Code Samples
*   Blog
*   Forum
*   FAQ
*   Pricing
*   Terms and Conditions

The most successful APIs also provide self-service developer tools:

*   Registration
*   Application Registration

API pioneers like [Ebay](http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/ "Ebay"), [Salesforce](http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/ "Salesforce"), [Flickr](http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/ "Flickr"), and Google have established a common set of essential API building blocks through trial and error over the last decade.

Other API providers can learn from this [API history](http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/10/history-of-apis-birth-through-social/ "API History") and experience, and make sure they start with the essential API building blocks for sucess.
