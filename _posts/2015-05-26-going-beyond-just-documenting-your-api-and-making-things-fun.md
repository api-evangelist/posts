I look at a lot of API documentation, something that until recently has been pretty static--pun intended. As an API consumer I really appreciate standardized approaches to documenting an API, like using [Swagger](http://swagger.io) or [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.com), but I also really enjoy when people go the extra mile to add little details, that make the experience a little more fun.

A recent example of this is from the [Spotify API team](https://developer.spotify.com). When it comes to the search endpoint for the Spotify API, they put in this little addition:

_T[he field filter tag:new can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums released in the last two weeks. The field filter tag:hipster can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums with the lowest 10% popularity.](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/)_

_I love shit like this. It makes the often mundane world of APIs, a lttle more bright. It shows that there is a human beneath the very technical story that is often being told as part of API operatoins._Â 

I don't about you, while I enjoy the self-service nature of APIs, where I don't have to deal with people and sales teams to be able to put a valuable resource to usee--I also enoy knowing there is a human behind the scenes. Especially if it someone who cares enough about an API enough to have fun, and enjoy themselves along the way.
