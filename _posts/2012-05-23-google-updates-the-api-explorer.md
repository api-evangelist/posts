Google just released an update to their [API Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/ "Google API Explorer").

Some of the new features include:

*   Indexed history of API calls
*   API request body editor
*   Search box for search APIs and methods
*   Indicator showing which methods require authentication

The [Google API Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/ "Google API Explorer") now supports two dozen Google APIs, up from only six when they first launched.

Googleâ€™s continued investment in their API explorer, which makes APIs not just easier to use, but more accessible to non-developers, really shows that an API explorer has become an [essential API building block](/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/ "essential API building block").
