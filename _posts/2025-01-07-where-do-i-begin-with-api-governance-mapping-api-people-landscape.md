With an understanding of the [API](https://apievangelist.com/2025/01/07/where-do-i-begin-with-api-governance-mapping-the-api-landscape/) and [operational](https://apievangelist.com/2025/01/07/where-do-i-begin-with-api-governance-mapping-the-operational-api-landscape/) landscape you must always map out the teams who are using any API being produced. Understanding the people and the tribes they belong to, as well rules, policies, and other things that shape their world is important. Many APIs will remain internal services and require little resources and governance, but other opportunities for productization and further investment in APIs will be defined by people and the bounded contexts they operate within.

  - **Domains** - The highest level of bounded context in which teams are working within.
  - **Groups** - Define any other bounded context which may define or divide groups working with APIs.
  - **Teams** - What are the specific teams that may be producing or consuming an API.
  - **Roles** - Who are the product and engineering leads, as well as any other role involved.
  - **People** - What are the actual names, personalities, skills, and other defining characteristics.

Without an understanding of the human landscape behind APIs any API governance effort will stumble. How quickly you can standardize APIs and increase the velocity of applications and integrations on top of those APIs will depend on the awareness, skills, and resources that teams, and the groups or domains they operate within possess. The API people landscape will define every aspect of your API governance, and inform where you begin with supporting and guiding teams towards the desired future state.
