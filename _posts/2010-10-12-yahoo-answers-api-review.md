[Yahoo! Answers](http://answers.yahoo.com/) is a community-driven question-and-answer (Q&A) site that allows users to both submit questions to be answered and answer questions asked by other users. The site gives members the chance to earn points as a way to encourage participation.

The [Yahoo! Answers API](http://developer.yahoo.com/answers/) is a RESTful API using an appID for authentication. It provides a read only API for querying questions individually, by search, category, or by user. Yahoo! provides 12 language kits including Java, PHP, and VB.Net.
