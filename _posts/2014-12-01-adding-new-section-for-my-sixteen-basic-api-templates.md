As I build out new APIs for use across my systems, as well as map out the landscape of valuable API resources available today, I'm [working to define templates](http://apievangelist.com/templates/) that other API providers can follow when designing and deploying their own API infrastructure. I've accumulated 16 basic templates, prompting me to [add a new section to the website called templates](http://apievangelist.com/templates/).

These projects represent the templates I've established through my existing research, and will add other templates as they come off the assembly line. These API designs aren't mean to be the perfect solution for production environements, but to be seeds for new conversation around APIs, as well as providing a basic pattern you can use to start your own development.

Each API is functional, and has its own Github repository for storing of a Swagger definition, Swagger UI Interactive Documentation, as well as the server side code that I will open source with each template. As I move forward each template, I will publish changes to their repos, as well as maintain a roadmap via each projects Github milestones.

My APIs are currently developed in PHP, but for me the real value is the Swagger API definitions, and eventually I will also generate Python, Ruby, and Node.js versions of these same APIs. The code is disposable in my mind, and my goal will be to evolve each of the template definitions.

I intend to create cloud container images  for all my API templates, providing blueprints others can use deploying on AWS, Heroku, Google App Engine, and othe popular cloud image formats, including Docker.

As I add features to my production versions of these APIs, I will carve these features off and add to [each templates](http://apievangelist.com/templates/). If you've taken one and added to it, feel free to share your patterns back with the community, and I'd be happy to showcase. I would also entertain the addition of any templates you would like to share with the community as well.
