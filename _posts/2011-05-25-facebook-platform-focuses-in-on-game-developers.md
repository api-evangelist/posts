kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Games.png)Tomorrow I'm participating in a session at [Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers](http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16 "Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers").

[Justin Tormey](http://twitter.com/#!/justintormey "Justin Tormey") of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.

Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched [Facebook + Games](http://www.facebook.com/fbandgames "facebook + Games"), a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.

I wrote about the the [Journalist on Facebook](http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/17/beyond-partners-and-developers-with-your-api/ "Journalist on Facebook") page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.

This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.
