[Foursquare released version 2.0 of its API](http://developer.foursquare.com/) today, after a year of development on the update.

*   OAuth 2.0 Authentication
*   User Badges
*   User Venue History
*   Bundled Request

Foursquare also dropped XML support, which has been a common move by API providers lately. JSON is fast becoming the preferred format of API providers and developers.

Foursquare didn't deliver everything people were asking for, but version 2.0 does provide some important architectural features that show the API is maturing and ready for the next round of growth.
