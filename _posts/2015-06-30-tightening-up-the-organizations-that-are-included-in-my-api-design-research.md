I try to go through each of my areas of research as often as I can and update the content, as well as my understanding. Ideally I update the news each week, take a look at the organizations involved once a month, and evaluate the building blocks and tools each quarter. Unfortunately it doesn't always happen as planned, but as a one man operation, I think I do pretty well. 

I just went through my [API design research](http://design.apievangelist.com), and adjusted my definition of what I felt needed be listed there. As I move API definitions to their own research area(s), I'm reconsidering what I want to keep an eye on when it comes to API design, and my current definition involves organizations who offer API design editors, either in the cloud or as download. They should allow you to add, edit, and manage the API details, then also provide the ability to import and export using common API definition format(s).

Currently I have nine organizations represented, as part of my API design research:

[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/apiary-io-logo.png)](https://apiary.io/)[**Apiary**](https://apiary.io/) Apiary jump-started the modern API design movement, by making API definitions more than just about API documentation, allowing API designers to define APIs in the machine readable API definition format API blueprint, then mock, share, and publish documentation via a cloud platform.

Opening up the ability for developers to design, mock, test and share via their online platform.

When you bundles this with their multi API definition format import and export, the platform quickly becomes an API design tool as well as a platform for generating your SDKs.

As I work to refine each of my research areas, it can be hard to draw the line where each projects starts, and ends. I had [Readme.io](http://readme.io), and [Wavemaker](http://wavemaker.com) on this list, but I really felt they were more in the [API management](http://management.apievangelist.com), and [API deployment](http://deployment.apievangelist.com) realms, resulting in me drawing the line where I did.

Next I am looking to tackle the API design tooling, which I am looking to organize into groups, as there is kind of a mash-up of different things there now. Hopefully I can break it all into a more coherent breakdown of not just the open tooling, but also open content, and other resources that might help all of us all in our API design journey. 

One thing I have to say after updating the list of organizations on my API design research, is I am impressed how far the services, tooling, and overall API design mindset has come in just two short years. We have more than one editor, with a couple of the implementations being open source--I'd say this is pretty healthy progress. ;-)
