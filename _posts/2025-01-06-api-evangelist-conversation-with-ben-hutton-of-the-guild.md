Ben Hutton of the Guild came by to talk about his [recent LinkedIn thread about APIs vs SDKs](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benhuttonuk_developers-dont-want-to-use-apis-they-activity-7275448234238517248-47lE). The topic is an evergreen one that brings out all of the opinions and is something that I enjoy talking with Ben about so that I can get his pragmatic view of things. Ben has a lot of experience as a software engineer and working on the JSON Schema specification, which I think gives him unique perspective on what is needed when it comes to integrating with APIs. Ben was on my open technologies team at Postman, but we are now collaborating around helping people understand the importance of getting their enterprise schema house in order.

I will be breaking down Ben's thread on LinkedIn, as well as our onversation to shape API Evangelist on SDKs. I am a fan of SDKs only when API producers actually know their API consumers, and they are asking for SDKs. Otherwise I am a strong believer that you should just provide OpenAPI and Bruno Collections and then get out of their way. [SDKs are an important ongoing API discussion](https://properties.apievangelist.com/store/sdk/) because many developers don't actually see the difference between them and would rather have the SDK. Thanks for coming by Ben, you can [find the conversation and transcript under the conversation section of API Evangelist](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/store/2025-01-06-ben-hutton-guild/), and I am looking forward to further unpacking what enterprises are needing from schema to SDKs in future conversations.
