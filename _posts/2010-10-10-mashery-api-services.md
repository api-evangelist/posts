[Mashery](http://www.mashery.com) is an API management service provider that offers an API as a Software as a Service (SaaS). You can leverage Mashery's platform to get an API planned, deployed, and into operation quickly. Mashery makes a pretty compelling [buy versus build argument when planning for your API](http://www.mashery.com/solution/buy_vs_build.html).

[Mashery](http://www.mashery.com) provides a wide array of tools in three distinct areas:

*   **API Management** building blocks like API registration, credential management, usage throttling and business rules.
*   **Metrics and Reporting** building blocks like API usage, developer activity, systems status, and real-time insights into API operations.
*   **Community Management** building blocks for blogs, wiki, general content management, change control, and forums.

Mashery is definitely the leader in this space. It has a robust set of API management features as well as a service level agreement and extensive API support portal.

Mashery also understands the [API developer network](http://developer.mashery.com/) to enable deeper integration of their API services.

Mashery's platform, collective experience, resources, and support makes it enticing to use them as a platform for launching and growing your API.
