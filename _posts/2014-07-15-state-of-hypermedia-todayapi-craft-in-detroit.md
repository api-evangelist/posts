I’m working with Brian Mulloy ([@landlessness](https://twitter.com/landlessness)) of [Apigee](http://apigee.com/), to organize six of the leading hypermedia experts for a 2 hour panel discussion on the state of hypermedia, at [API Craft, in Detroit, Michigan](http://api-craft.org/) this month. I couldn't imagine a more distinguished panel of hypermedia experts, than this lineup:

*   Mike Amundsen ([@mamund](https://twitter.com/mamund))
*   Mike Kelly ([@mikekelly85](https://twitter.com/mikekelly85))
*   Steve Klabnik ([@steveklabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik))
*   Kevin Swiber ([@kevinswiber](https://twitter.com/kevinswiber))
*   Jørn Wildt ([@JornWildt](https://twitter.com/JornWildt))
*   Markus Lanthaler ([@MarkusLanthaler](https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler))

The 2 hour panel is going to be broken into an hour of 10 minute presentations from each of the six panelists, followed by another hour of QA discussion between myself, the panelists, and the API Craft audience.

I’ve started a [Github repository to gather thoughts for the discussion](https://github.com/kinlane/api-craft-hypermedia-panel-detroit-2014), from the panelists, and if you have anything you'd like me to discuss, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/kinlane/api-craft-hypermedia-panel-detroit-2014/issues/new), and I'll consider including in the discussion.

See you in Detroit!
