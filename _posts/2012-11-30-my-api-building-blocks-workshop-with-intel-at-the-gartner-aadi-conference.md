I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas. Working from my [Building Blocks of a Successful API](/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php) material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.

My workshop started with the [history of APIs](http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History), then walked through [API building blocks](http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/) in 3 areas:

*   API Design 
*   API Development 
*   API Evangelist

Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research & development and business development for your company.

After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like [Singly](http://singly.com "Singly"), API automation platforms like [IFTT](http://ifttt.com) and new API programming libraries like [Webshell](http://webshell.io).

The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee’s mind:

*   APIs Are More Than Tech 
*   APIs Require a Business Approach 
*   Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs 
*   Focus Delivering Value

You can view the slide deck below for the workshop. If you’d like a custom demo feel free to contact me and we can do a Google Hangout.
