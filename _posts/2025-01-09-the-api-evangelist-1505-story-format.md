Back in the early days of API Evangelist we employed a simple rapid fire approach to storytelling that seemed to fit with the appetite of people who were seeking more information about the API lifecycle. With version 4.0 of API Evangelist we are putting back in place our 1505 story format to bring some more discipline back into the writing on the site by following the following rules.

- **1 Picture** - A picture is worth a thousand words of a story.
- **250 Words** - A couple of sentences to open things up.
- **5 Bullets** - When it makes sense, add five bullet points.
- **250 Words** - A Couple of sentences to close things up.

The goal with this format is to open the conversation with an image, then provide 1-2 sentences to introduce a topic, 3-5 bullets to emphasize what is happening, and then close things up with just a couple more sentences. The math works like this. 1000 (picture) + 250 (words) + 5 (bullets) + 250 (words) == 1505. It keeps things short, the cognitive load light, and the cadence rapid fire.
