[Deltacloud](http://deltacloud.org) provides aggregated access to multiple cloud computing platforms in a single web service. Deltacloud currently supports seven major cloud computing platforms including [Rackspace](http://www.rackspacecloud.com/) and [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

The Deltacloud API delivers a RESTful API using HTTP Authentication. The web service provides access to hardware profiles, realms, images, and instances. It provides a Ruby client, but no other language kits.

Building Blocks:

*   Overview
*   Post-Install
*   REST API
*   Drivers
*   Framework
*   Ruby Client
*   Image Builder

The Deltacloud API is free and open source and is available under the LGPL and GPL and licenses.

The Deltacloud API, along with its documentation, is available for download, and you can contribute and participate on the wiki.
