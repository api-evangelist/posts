[Digg](http://www.digg.com) is a social news site that allows users to submit and vote up or down news stories published by others.

Digg offers a RESTful API, with oAuth authentication. The API gives access to just about all functionality available through the interface, including topics, stories, users, comments and search. Digg provides PHP and Python language libraries allowing developers to quickly consume the API.
