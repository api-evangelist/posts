[We dedicated time recently to map out a high-level overview of what API producers offer to make onboarding and integration easier for API consumers](https://apievangelist.com/2025/01/12/api-openapi-collections-docs-explorer-playground-clients-sdks-and-integrations/). We analyzed the distribution and adoption of third-party APIs by documenting the producer and consumer perspectives across key elements: APIs, OpenAPI specifications, Collections, Documentation, Explorers, Playgrounds, SDKs, and Integrations. Our goal was to understand the motivations of both API producers and consumers, identifying what is essential for effectively leveraging APIs. From this research, we aimed to answer a straightforward question: as an API producer, should we invest in SDKs, or is there a baseline set of resources our consumers will require?

- **Know Your Consumers** - Whether or not you offer SDKs should be driven by an awareness of what your consumers need.
- **OpenAPI Base** - Every API should have a complete OpenAPI, which is essential in answering yes and no to this question.
- **API Documentation** - Make sure your API documentation is rich, robust, and completed, before you get to work answering this.
- **API Governance** - Put in place a minimal set of policies, rules, and review checkpoints for your APIs before delivering SDKs.
- **Self-Service** - Should you be producing SDKs, or can you just assist consumers by providing the resources they need to do it.
- **Build vs. Buy** - You should be seriously considering the pros and cons of building vs. buying to help answer this question.

The answer to this question will vary across enterprises and APIs, and it should be based on actual evidence of what consumers need, rather than speculation. We recommend starting with a complete OpenAPI specification and comprehensive API documentation as your baseline. Next, implement API governance to ensure consistency and quality. Based on actual consumer demand, you can then prioritize developing SDKs in the languages your consumers require. If you lack dedicated resources for specific programming languages, consider using a [professional SDK provider like APIMATIC](https://bit.ly/3NyONos).

By establishing a solid foundation with an OpenAPI specification and documentation, governing your OpenAPI artifacts, and maintaining strong feedback loops with your API consumers, youâ€™ll be better positioned to confidently determine whether investing in SDKs is necessary.
