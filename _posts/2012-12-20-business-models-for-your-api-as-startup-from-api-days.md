Here is a video of one of my talks from [API Days in Paris](http://apidays.io/ "API Days"), France where I walked through potential thoughts on business model for a hypothetical startup. Â I had a separate talk prepared, but after attending the first day I went and found a french cafe, drank a couple bottles of wine, took what I learned and produced this talk.

If you want to see my slide deck from this talk, you can find a published version [business for your API as a startup](http://apievangelist.com/talks/apidays/business-models/#/), using deck.js off my talks sections of API Evangelist.

Thanks again to [Faber Novel](http://www.fabernovel.com/en/) and [Webshell](http://webshell.io "Webshell") for putting on such a great event, and producing these cool videos.
