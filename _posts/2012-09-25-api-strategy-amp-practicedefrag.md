When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to. To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!

When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences. [Gluecon](http://gluecon.com/2012/ "Gluecon") is usually in the spring and [Defrag](http://www.defragcon.com/2012/ "Defrag") is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.

[Defrag is coming up November 15th and 16th](http://www.defragcon.com/2012/)\--right after November 1st and 2nd for theÂ [API Strategy & Practice in NYC.](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php "API Strategy & Practice Conference")

API Strategy & Conference is psyched to be partnering with Defrag in our first year. If you [register for API Strategy & Conference](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php "Register for API strategy"), you will get 10% off of your registration for Defrag.

The event combination will make November a great time to immerse yourself in the API industry, with API Strategy & Practice Conference, then two weeks later, go further with Internet technology discussions at Defrag.

I look forward to seeing you at both [API Strategy & Practice Conference](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php "API Strategy & Practice") and [Defrag](http://www.defragcon.com/2012/ "Defrag") in November!
