Mashery has published videos from the event on their site.

The event focused on the growing need to distribute information to a multitude of Internet connected devices using APIs, andMashery invited four leaders in the API space to showcase their experience:

*   [Kumar Kandaswamy](http://twitter.com/#!/Kumar_K "Kumar Kandaswamy"), Director,[Open API Platform Business for Best Buy](http://www.bbyopen.com/ "Open API Platform Business for Best Buy")

*   [Edwin Aoki](http://twitter.com/#!/edwinaoki "Edwin Aoki"), Chief Architect of PayPal/eBay
