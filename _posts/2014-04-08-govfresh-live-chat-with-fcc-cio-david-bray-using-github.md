I stumbled into a pretty interesting use of Github yesterday, which I’m seeing as part of a greater push from our government to use the popoular social coding platform. The government blog [Govfresh](http://govfresh.com/) held a live chat session with FCC CIO David Bray ([@fcc\_cio](https://twitter.com/fcc_cio)), where some really interesting questions were asked of the very progressive CIO.

I’m going to break up a few of the questions into separate blog posts, what I wanted to highlight in this post was the use of Github as a chat forum, showing once again that the platform isn’t just about managing code, but can be used to openly manage a multitude of collaborative government technical operations.

Luke Fretwell ([@lukefretwell](https://twitter.com/lukefretwell)) opened up the discussion which ran for about an hour, asking Bray several questions, and then Steve Spiker ([@spjika](https://twitter.com/spjika)), myself and the infamous Alex Howard ([@digiphile)](https://twitter.com/digiphile) chimed in with further questions—making for a pretty interesting discussion.

Govfresh used [Gitchat](https://github.com/gitrun/chat), a way of turning Github Issue Management + Github APIs into a chat thread, for the conversation. I like this approach to managing and controlling a live conversation, with the ability to archive for future use. I think it is also a great way to help people in government understand that Github is more than just code, it is also about being very social and collaborative around technical ideas.
