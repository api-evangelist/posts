The mobile app development space has grown into such an opportunity, it has begun to attract the attention of some of the heaviest hitters in the API space, Amazon Web Services, SalesForce and RackSpace.

These tech giants are evolving their approach to delivering the cloud resources so that it better meets the demands of mobile developers,  This movement signals the beginning of consolidation in the BaaS space, and the Commoditization of many of the common BaaS building blocks.

While it is a positive for the space that analysts are identifying as a $7.7 billion opportunity by 2017, and that top players like AWS, RackSpace and SalesForce are noticing, it could point to the beginning of the end for many of the start-up BaaS providers.
