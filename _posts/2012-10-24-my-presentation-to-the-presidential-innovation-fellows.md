I spent two hours with a handful of the [Presidential Innovation Fellows](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows) in Washington DC yesterday. They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.

During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of the API industry, from my perspective, including:

*   History of APIs
*   API Planning & Design
*   API Development
*   Business of APIs
*   API Service Providers
*   API Tools, Services, Platforms
*   Politics of APIs
*   API Evangelism
*   What’s Next for APIs

You can access my [innovation fellows presentation off API Evangelist](/federal-digital-strategy/innovation-fellows/), I’ll leave it up permanently. It’s minus all my commentary and banter, but hopefully it will give you an idea of what I covered. If you’d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I’ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.

I had a blast talking to the Presidential Fellows, and I hope that I left them with some value that will help them be successful in their various initiatives. They are already halfway through their sprint, and have a lot of expectations put on them.

I will be following their progress closely and publish any stories I can on their progress.
