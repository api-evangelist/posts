We spent the last part of 2024 breaking down what we’ve learned about API governance over the last five years (15 really), and the month of January workshopping the different ways in which we could share this knowledge with enterprise teams. We settled on delivering knowledge bases for each of the areas we feel contribute the most to governance of enterprise APIs, but after talking with folks, we couldn’t agree on a single way to deliver these knowledge bases into the enterprises. So, to help get the conversation going about the best possible way to bring this knowledge home, while still making the knowledge available to product and engineering people fighting the good API governance fight, we settled in on [weekly knowledge building sessions](https://apievangelist.com/#knowledge) for each of the following areas.

### Tuesday

- [**Schema @ 1:00 PM EST**](https://bases.apievangelist.com/store/schema/) - Covering what you need to define and validate API operations.
- [**APIs @ 2:00 PM EST**](https://bases.apievangelist.com/store/apis/) - Understanding the fundamentals of producing and consuming APIs.
- [**Governance @ 3:00 PM EST**](https://bases.apievangelist.com/store/governance/) - Looking at the current and future state of governing our APIs.

### Thursday

- [**Operations @ 1:00 PM EST**](https://bases.apievangelist.com/store/operations/) - Expanding governance to the wider operations surrounding APIs.
- [**Changes @ 2:00 PM EST**](https://bases.apievangelist.com/store/changes/) - Turning change into an asset rather than it being a liability.
- [**Evangelism @ 3:00 PM EST**](https://bases.apievangelist.com/store/evangelism/) - Collaborating and communicating in real-time around APIs.

[Knowledge building](https://apievangelist.com/#knowledge) sessions are paid, and we are charging $169.00 USD per person, per session. We will be running weekly for the next six months to see if it is something people are in need of. We will gather feedback each week to iterate upon the content, but keeping within the fundamental six areas. In a couple of weeks we will launch a rotating mix of 101, 201, and 301 sessions, but we feel pretty strongly that enterprises must be focusing on these basics, and getting their house in order in respect to the API sprawl.

We are hopeful that these areas will reflect what enterprises need, and will shift a portion of our weekly storytelling to support these fundamentals. Our belief is that in this time of AI uncertainty some folks will want to come in from the storm and learn how they better equip their teams with the basics of APIs, work to tame some of the sprawl, and bring some stability to their API operations. Who knows, people still seem pretty distracted with AI in 2025, and we might be wrong about people wanting to get their house in order, but we still have to give it a shot. 

Feel free to drop us an email, sign-up for any of the sessions, and we’d love to keep hearing your feedback on what your enterprise needs when it comes to API governance. API governance knowledge bases and builder sessions will be 50% of how we intend to monetize and sustain API Evangelist, complimented by site sponsorship by partners providing the other 50%. We will explore other ways of sustaining our work in the future, but this is what we came around to after doing six months, and feel will have the greatest positive impact on the API conversation, without extracting value from enterprises.
