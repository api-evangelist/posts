I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, using Evernote. Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate. 

I saw the recent Heartbleed SSL situation as an opportunity to move forward some of my IT practices, including [using 1Password to manage all of my accounts](http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/12/downloading-1password-from-agilebits/), and better profiling which APIs I'm consuming. This gave me an opportunity to update my list of APIs that I depend on, adding about 4 or 5 new ones.

First I depend on a couple of the core Google APIs:

[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/gmail-logo.jpeg)](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/gmail/ "Gmail API")

**[Gmail](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/gmail/ "Gmail API")** - Integrate my daily emails, as well as email blasts with my administrative system

[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-contacts-logo.png)](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/ "Google Contacts API")

**[Google Contacts](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/ "Google Contacts API")** - Keep business and individual profiles in my admin system in sync with my daily Google Contacts activity.

[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-calendar-logo.png)](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/ "Google Calendar API")

**[Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/ "Google Calendar API")** - Publish hackathon calendars to Google Calendar as well as keep conferences, meetups and other events I pull through APIs and curate in sync

[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-docs-icon.png)](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/documents-list/ "Google Docs API")

**[Google Docs](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/documents-list/ "Google Docs API")** - Publish copies of blog posts to Google Docs, as well as version of pages from my content management system to Google Docs

**[Google Sites](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/sites/ "Google Sites API")** - All of my research is in Google Sites. So I tend to publish lists of curated news, blog posts and other research to wiki pages under specific projects

Next, I would say Amazon Web Services delivers some pretty critical APIs I can't live without:

[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/amazon-ec2-icon.png)](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ "Amazon EC2")

**[Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ "Amazon EC2")** - I deploy and shutdown various EC2 instances for various jobs I run for API Evangelist. All APIs are managed on AWS EC2

**[Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ "Amazon S3")** - All heavy objects in my systems are stored at Amazon S3 including photos, PDFs, presentations and video

Then there are an assortment of other APIs I use throughout my web sites and applications:

I depend on these APIs to run [API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com "API Evangelist"), as well as support the other research and consulting that I do. Some of these services I pay for, some of them I use for free.  

I’m sure I depend on a lot of APIs, partly because this is my game, I’m an API Evangelist, but it is also because APIs provide me with the data and resources I need to operate.

Tracking on the APIs I depend is a regular part of my IT strategy, and eventually I am going to publish this as a public page on my websites--showcasing what APIs have done for my business.
