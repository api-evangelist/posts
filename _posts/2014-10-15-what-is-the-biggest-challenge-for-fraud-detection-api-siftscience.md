I’m spending more time reaching out directly to API providers, in an effort to better understand what they are up to. A couple weeks ago, I asked Sarfaraz Rydhan ([@safoo](https://twitter.com/safoo)) from the [Fraud Detection API platform SiftScience](https://siftscience.com/), what is the biggest challenge you face in attracting developers to your system?

> _In many cases, the biggest challenge is developers needing context into the business and operations side of the companies they work for. We offer a machine learning powered fraud detection product to help internet companies in many verticals fight fraud. In an e-commerce integration, for example, a developer may need to know about how users interact with the store, when a customer's credit card is charged, how order information is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment, how operations analysts work within the e-commerce system._

Context--something that is so important, and is often lost in translation, or forgotten entirely when APIs are purely an IT or developer led initiative. As a developer I can easily see the many uses of an API, but articulating to someone who is actually living within one of these use-case scenarios, is very difficult—something that takes a lot of practice.

You can see SiftScience working to provide context to its users via its [website](https://siftscience.com/), [blog](http://blog.siftscience.com/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/siftscience), and other [tutorials and resources](https://siftscience.com/resources/tutorials/integration.html). As API providers, this is why we provide essential storytelling building blocks like a blog, tutorials, and other resources—to provide the critical context someone needs to understand the value that our APIs deliver.

Are you providing enugh context for your users?
