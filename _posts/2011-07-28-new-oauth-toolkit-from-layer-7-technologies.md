[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/OAuth.png)](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=184 "OAuth")[Layer 7 Technologies](http://www.layer7tech.com/ "Layer 7 Technologies") introduced a new [OAuth Toolkit](http://www.layer7tech.com/products/oauth-toolkit "OAuth Toolkit"), ageneralized framework for handling a broad range of OAuth scenarios across cloud, web and mobile applications.

[OAuth](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=184 "OAuth") is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data, and is a popular method to allow secure API authorization, enabling websites to provide a more streamlined user login experience with the additional benefits of enhanced privacy and security.kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com

The Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit is the first solution of its kind that enables enterprises to control policy and identity aspects of many different OAuth token operations, a capability that is particularly important as enterprises increasingly use OAuth to authorize access to APIs in cloud settings, said Phil Walston, vice president of products at Layer 7 Technologies. By allowing enterprises to seamlessly manage their OAuth implementations as the standard evolves, the toolkit simplifies operations while providing rigorous security and control.[![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/layer7-logo.png)](http://www.layer7tech.com/ "Layer 7 Technologies")

Features of the Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit are:

*   Policy and identity controls to handle HMAC-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signature methods, SAML and OAuth WRAP
*   Mix and match implementations of OAuth with SAML
*   Ability to drop in new signature and credential methods without changing APIs

Layer 7's new OAuth Toolkit supports a variety of standards, including OAuth 1a, OAuth 2.0, SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, WS-Trust, [REST](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=196 "REST") and [JSON](http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/27/api-technology-json/ "JSON").

Layer 7 will be demonstrating its OAuth Toolkit at the Layer 7 Hospitality Suite at [Gartner's Catalyst Conference](http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/catalyst/ "Gartners Catalyst Conference") at the San Diego Hilton Bayfront, Aqua Room 311, from 6:00 - 9:00 p.m., July 26-29.
