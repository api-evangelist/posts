As we gear up for [API Strategy & Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php), I’m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a [listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom](http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/apis-coming-out-of-the-united-kingdom/) a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.

Last week I did a [roundup of 17 APIs out of the Netherlands](http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/04/apis-coming-out-of-the-netherlands/), but thanks to Twitter, and specifically Gerard van Enk ([@gvenk](https://twitter.com/gvenk)) who was curating a spreadsheet of APIs, I was able to double the amount of APIs I'm tracking on out of the country.

[**Dutch Schools**](http://api.openonderwijsdata.nl/)

The educational system in the Netherlands is complex, and many public bodies are tasked with keeping schools and students on the right track. However, data regarding this task is made available to the general public in a way it is not easily processable, which makes checks by the public (and press) more difficult. The OpenOnderwijs API alleviates this problem by providing a unified interface to data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as DUO, Onderwijsinspectie and Vensters voor Verantwoording. The OpenOnderwijs API is built on open source technology, such as Scrapy for scraping school data (the scrapers can be found at Github), Sphinx for the documentation, and ElasticSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval. Also, all school addresses are geocoded using the BAG42 service, an Dutch initiative aiming to integrate high quality, official data sources with “regular” geocoding.

What I see when I look through these 34 APIs, is a wealth of creative talent exposing their resources as APIs. You have art, museums, images, photos, music and other right brain activity. 

With multiple Paris API events, and a single API event in Madrid so far, I'm very pleased with the types of API conversations going on in Europe, and getting really excited to see who comes together to talk APIs in Amsterdam. 

I’m sure there are still other Dutch API efforts I’m missing, so if you know of any companies with a significant presence in the Netherlands, doing cool stuff with APIs, make sure and let me know[@kinlane](https://twitter.com/kinlane).
