When you first land on any [API developer landing page](https://www.etsy.com/developers/), the impression you get, can be one of the most important aspects of on-boarding with an API that I know of. More time than not, I'm pretty confused when I land on the landing page of APIs, being forced to look for what I need to get up and running with API what an API does, and how I will have to integrate with it.

Anytime I come across an API landing page, where I'm immediately given the best possible first impression I can image, I have to showcase. This just happened while taking another look at the Etsy API, which I found refreshingly simple--yet complete.

Everything on the [Etsy API developer landing page](https://www.etsy.com/developers/) has a purpose in assisting me during on-boarding with the Etsy API. To better understand this in action, let's look at the handful of essential API management building blocks available on the Etsy home page.

When I land at etsy.com/developers/, immediately I’m given a Flexible Messaging Area (FMA), telling me what is possible! It is not just one simple message, as I advocate for constantly, it is a slideshow of multiple, simple messages. #winning

**What Does The API Do?**  
Beyond understand what the Etsy API does in 250 characters or less, I get a prominent link to the API documentation, discussion around the API, and the terms of use for the API—-BOOM, everything I need. Way to give me exactly what I need so far to get up and running, while also getting out of the way.

**How Do I On-Board With An API?**  
Next, there is a pretty clear blue highlighted box, that helps me understand the connection between my Etsy seller account, and registering as a developer. I’m given what I need to register as a developer, and also configure my Etsy shop for proper integration.

**Do I Actually Need To Integrate Myself?**  
After than, I’m asked if I am look for Etsy App? Maybe that is all I need. I don’t actually need to integrate with Etsy myself, I’m look to see if the integration I need has already been done. I just need an application to meet my needs—nice use of an application showcase Etsy.

**Work At Etsy - See current openings!**  
I’ll let you in on a little secret. API ecosystem are often used for talent acquisition. shhhhhh!!! So, Etsy having a section on the home page about working at Etsy, just makes sense. If you are finding yourself in the Etsy Developer area, you are probably a little more curious than the average visitor, and quite possibly someone that Etsy might consider hiring.

**Storytelling: Code As Craft**  
I’m a loyal fan of Etsy’s Code As Craft blog, so I’m not going to knock the fact that their home page blog widget isn’t performing as expected. I’m guessing normally I would see the last 3 posts from the blog, which in my opinion is essential operations for ANY API landing page. I’m sure the Etsy one will be up and running as normal shortly. ;-)

**Everything I Need To Keep Me Connected To The Entire Etsy Platform**  
Providing a complete picture of platform operations is essential for any online service provider. When I’m on your main website, I shouldn’t have to work to hard to find your API or developer area, and vice versa, I do not want to have to work to get back to the main website, and other sections of a site. Etsy provides what I need to search and browse Etsy, and register or sign into my primary account—directly from the API developer area.

What started as a pretty straightforward review of an API--routine going back through my list of APis I monitor--ended up being surprisingly good first impression of an API, I've been to several times before.
