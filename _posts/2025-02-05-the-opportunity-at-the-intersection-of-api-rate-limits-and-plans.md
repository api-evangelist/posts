One of the knowledge builders we are working on right now is focused on [API service composition](https://apievangelist.com/2025/01/27/what-is-api-service-composition/). We recently [talked with Zuplo about their view of API rate limits and planning from the gateway perspective](https://apievangelist.com/2025/01/30/api-evangelist-conversation-with-adrian-machado-staff-software-engineer-at-zuplo/), as well as had a conversation with Moesif about the same intersection from their API monetization and analytics perspective. The Moesif podcast will be released soon. Our favorite thing about API intersections is that when they are properly invested in they can become a bridge between product and engineering groups to optimize around the delivery of APIs. There are numerous API intersections to consider but rate limits, which are very technical one, also can lead to many interesting business details that can contribute to building a bridge using the following planks.

- **Manage Technical Resources** - Rate limits force you to think critically about how much of a resource you can afford to make available.
- **Optimize Transport of Resources** - Pushes you to better understand and optimize at the HTTP transport layer using your API headers.
- **Develop Consumer Understanding** - To set rate limits you have to put some thought into who your consumers are and how they will use them.
- **Open Up Revenue Opportunities** - Once you have a better understanding of your resources and consumers, you find where revenue is.
- **Incentivize Team Coordination** - Align the product and engineering interests into something that properly motivates ongoing coordination.
- **Quantify API Value Exchange**  - Clear understanding of what a digital resource costs to provide and what its value is for the API consumers.

The intersection of API rate limits and plans demonstrates how a very technical API governance detail can be used to align engineering with wider enterprise business objectives. It provides one example of how the governance of HTTP rate limit headers using Spectral rules transcends engineering and reveals whether or not there is a wider business plan in place for an API. The Spectral or Vacuum rule for HTTP rate limit headers is governing more than just the technical details, it is governing the business details. Equipped with this knowledge,  API governance teams can expand beyond just looking for headers in the design of an API and begin connecting each API operation with cost and revenue information, terms of service, licensing, compliance, or any other business detail associated with individual API resources and capabilities. The opportunity at the intersection of API rate limits and plans is not a new one, and one weâ€™ve been telling stories about for the last fifteen years, and confident that we will be for another fifteen.
