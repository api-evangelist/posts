[Claire Barrett, Digital strategist at APIsFirst](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/sessions/2024-12-11-claire-barrett-apisfirst.html) came by to talk with me about the realities on the ground with APIs in large enterprises and the increasing chatter regarding the return on investment APIs. Claire's view of things is what API service providers should be tuning into when it comes to aligning product with engineering, treating APIs as a product, and making sense of the real world things business leadership are looking for. I'm thankful for Claire's perspective, but also all the work she does around APIDays, and Women in APIs, but also just being outspoken about the business value of being API-first.

What Claire speaks of is a reflection of what priorities will be in 2025. The bill is coming due for our API sprawl behind web and mobile applications, and we will get the first bills for our AI application rollout in the new year. If you want to learn more about Claire's view of things you can [download a report she has published with Treblle on the Anatomy of an API](https://report.treblle.com/). Accounting for business value and driving more efficiencies is going to a regular theme you will hear from the enterprise in 2025, and I encourage API leadership to think deeply about the services and tooling they've invested in, as well where they stand with API discovery and governance to help them with all of the accounting they will be doing in 2025.
