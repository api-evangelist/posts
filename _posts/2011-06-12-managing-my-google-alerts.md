I am making some adjustments to my [Google Alerts](http://www.google.com/alerts/ "Google Alerts") today.

I removed a few and added a few alerts.

Here are my current Google Alerts:

*   call for papers
*   kin lane
*   open API
*   REST API
*   self publishing
*   self-publishing
*   API Evangelist
*   apple airprint
*   Application Programming Interface
*   Google Cloud Print
*   hackathon
*   HP ePrint
*   Print on Demand
*   Web Services

I have all of them delivered once a day, via RSS feeds. This way I can monitor in real-time using Google Reader.

I adjust these every week if I can, but sometimes it remains pretty constant. It depends on topic.
