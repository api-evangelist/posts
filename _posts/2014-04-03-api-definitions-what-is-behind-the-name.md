Last week at [#APIStrat Amsterdam](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/), I moderated, and presented in a session that was called API service descriptions. I gave the talk for the first 15 minutes, then Sumit Sharma ([@sumitcan](https://twitter.com/sumitcan)), Ole Lensmar ([@olensmar](https://twitter.com/olensmar)), and Ruben Verborgh ([@RubenVerborgh](https://twitter.com/RubenVerborgh)) followed me-- the [full video is on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqQxM6PAuh0) if you are interested.

Over the last couple months I've been [doing a deeper dive](http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/) into the area of [API design](http://design.apievangelist.com), with a specific look at API definition formats from [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org/), [RAML](/admin/blog/RAML) and [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core), so the session was intended to help me continue the conversation, in person, on the stage at #APIStrat Amsterdam. I'm happy I did, because Ole came to the table with some valuable data on API definitions, that save me some valuable research hours.

I'm breaking up his work into several smaller posts, you can find his [full deck on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/SmartBear_Software/api-strat-2014metadataformatsshort), first up is a comparison overview of each API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger:

Ole provides a nice overview of the three leading API definition formats, giving API providers a good side-by-side summary that can be used when deciding which format to support. I will work with Ole to help keep the numbers up to date, and include in my final research white paper for API design when finished.

Thank you too Ole Lensmar ([@olensmar](https://twitter.com/olensmar)) and [Smartbear Software](http://smartbear.com/) for doing this research, and allowing me to share it with you.
