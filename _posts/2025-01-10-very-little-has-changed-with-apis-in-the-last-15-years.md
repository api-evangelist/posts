API Evangelist has been talking with enterprise API leadership since 2010, and in the last fifteen years, very little has changed, aside from a focus on APIs as a product evolving, API governance become top of mind, and maybe the concept of Microservices—all of this would reflect a conversation with enterprises in 2010. Granted, more companies are further along in their API journey, and there are many, many, many more APIs in production in 2025, but the conversation is basically the same. 

Errrr wrong, we were talking about APIs and Artificial Intelligence in 2012 (Wolfram Alpha, IBM Watson CHANGED EVERYTHING)—there was quite a hype phase for a bit, not like today, but there was one. 

The point of this post isn’t to shame folks, it is to acknowledge the work on the table for enterprises today. The choice really comes down to whether enterprises will continue to chase each wave of technological hype, or will invest in standardizing and stabilizing the existing foundation of their enterprise—HTTP APIs. API Evangelist is 100% focused on surveying and assessing the API landscape, and providing downloadable governance that enterprise can take back and apply centrally as part of platform and top-down governance efforts, or in a more tactical and federated way—just let us know where you need the most help.
