[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG)](http://instagr.am/)The mobile photo sharing site [Instagram officially launched an API this evening](http://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api).

This comes just under a month after the c[ompany asked developers to stop using a rogue API](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/) that was reverse engineered by an outside developer.

[Instagram](http://instagr.am/) is accepting signups for access to their new API at:

*   [http://instagr.am/developer/](http://instagr.am/developer/)

Developers will be notified when they open up access.

[Kevin Systrom](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-systrom "Kevin Systrom"), Instagram CEO says, That the first step to creating a lasting company is to work with the many talented developers out there in the world.

Instagram addreses image security and reassures that users will retain full ownership and privacy controls over all images.

The Instagram API merely allows talented developers to create really neat and useful apps for you to get more out of your images.
