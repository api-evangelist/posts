As we gear up for [API Strategy & Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php), I’m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a [listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom](http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/apis-coming-out-of-the-united-kingdom/) a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.

You tend to not think of what country an API is from, unless its attached to public infrastructure, or a company is extremely vocal about their home country. I confess that I couldn’t name a single API from Amsterdam before this week, but now I notice that Distimo, Drillster, ElasticSearch, Peerreach, and TwitterCounter were all out of the Netherlands, and were APIs I am already familiar with.

I was able to easily find 17 separate APIs out of the Netherlands:

The Arts Holland data platform, developer's site and SPARQL tutorial are created and hosted by Waag Society.

The Democracy API enables developers to interact with the Democracy web site programmatically. It's designed to make it possible for anyone to improve Democracy or integrate Democracy into other applications. You can develop a Democracy interface for a mobile phone, build a Democracy widget for your blog, or develop an application that makes it easy to post photos to your feed from your iPhone.

[**Distimo**](http://www.distimo.com/app-analytics)

[**Dutch Schools**](http://api.openonderwijsdata.nl/)

The educational system in the Netherlands is complex, and many public bodies are tasked with keeping schools and students on the right track. However, data regarding this task is made available to the general public in a way it is not easily processable, which makes checks by the public (and press) more difficult. The OpenOnderwijs API alleviates this problem by providing a unified interface to data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as DUO, Onderwijsinspectie and Vensters voor Verantwoording. The OpenOnderwijs API is built on open source technology, such as Scrapy for scraping school data (the scrapers can be found at Github), Sphinx for the documentation, and ElasticSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval. Also, all school addresses are geocoded using the BAG42 service, an Dutch initiative aiming to integrate high quality, official data sources with “regular” geocoding.

[**Weather API**](http://erikr.github.io/weerapi/)

This is a very basic JSON API for very basic weather data from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.

Currently, it only offers a single API call, for the latest weather observations at 36 monitoring stations.

I noticed numerous open data portals as I was doing my research into APIs out of the Netherlands, which I will showcase in a separate post—you can tell there is a serious passion for open data in the country.

I’m sure there are other Dutch API efforts I’m missing, so if you know of any companies with a significant presence in the Netherlands, doing cool stuff with APIs, make sure and let me know [@kinlane](https://twitter.com/kinlane).
