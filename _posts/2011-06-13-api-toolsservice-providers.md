[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/Appstores.png)](http://appstores.com/)When I review a new API, I take a look at the technology they provide, but I tend to focus on the business of their API.

One area I look at, is what tools they use to deliver the [building blocks that make up their API](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php "building blocks that make of their API"). Did they build it themselves? Did they use [Mashery](http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/ "Mashery"), [Apigee](http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/ "Apigee") or [3Scale](http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/ "3Scale")? Are they using other open-source tools or a software as a service (SaaS) provider?

I'm always on the look out for new open-source tools or services providers that can be leveraged for APIs in this way. My goal is to find an open-source solution or service provider for [each one of the building blocks I have defined](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php "each one of the building blocks i have defined"). Some examples are:

*   [API documentation with SDK Bridge](http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/api-documentation/ "API documentation with SDK Bridge")
*   [API forums with Get Satisfaction](http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/30/api-forums-using-get-satisfaction/ "API forums with Get Satisfaction")
*   [Application Showcase with AppStores.com](http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/08/a-white-label-api-appstore-platform/ "Application Showcase with AppStores.com")

I like to have an open-source tool available for each building block, but having a solid company that can deliver specialized services for a API, and have them up and running instantly is even better.

Some characteristics I look for in a service provider are:

*   **Self-service** \- Instant registration and activation of services.
*   **Branding** - The ability to brand and make look like your API area.
*   **Tiered Pricing** \- A pay as you go model allowing small companies to try out first, then grow as needed.
*   **DNS** - Ability to point subdomain at service, to keep with a single company domain.
*   **Support** - Quality support from self-service forum to someone you can talk to.
*   **Focus** - Delivering a high quality service ina single area, and not trying to be everything to everyone.
*   **Data Portability** - The ability to take **ALL** of your data with you when you are ready to leave is critical.

These are just a few of the key strengths I look for when finding [API tool](http://apievangelist.com/category/tools/ "API Tool") and [service providers](http://apievangelist.com/category/services/ "service providers").

As an example, take a look at [AppStores.com](http://appstores.com/ "AppStores.com"), they have almost everything I look for in a [building block](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php "building block") service provider. They are still working on the self-service and tiered pricing aspects, but its at least on their roadmap.

Do you have any open-source tools or software as a service providers that you use to deliver your API?
