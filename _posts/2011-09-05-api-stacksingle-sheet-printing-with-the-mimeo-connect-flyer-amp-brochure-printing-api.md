The Mimeo Connect Flyer & Brochure Printing API allows developers to submit PDF files, and order commercially printed flyers and brochures with different folds, color, paper, coating and hole punch from within your web and mobile applications.

The Flyer & Brochure Printing API provides a RESTful interface, using application keys for authentication, with responses in XML or JSON. Â There are seven API methods for getting proofs, quotes, shipping options, place order and retrieve print order status.

The Mimeo Connect Flyer & Brochure API for large format printing is a perfect tool for the API stack.
