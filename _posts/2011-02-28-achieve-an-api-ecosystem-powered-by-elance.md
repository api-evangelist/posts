Taking an API from area to community takes a lot of work. It just doesn't happen overnight. It takes a perfect balance of technology, developers, partners, resources and hard work. ![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ecosystem.png) APIs are a big part of the future of a distributed workforce, and developer communities like [Elance](http://www.elance.com "Elance") are building the workforce to support the APIs. You can leverage the Elance platform to:

*   Providing High Quality, Professional Developers
*   Develop API SDK and Code Samples
*   Develop API skills test and accreditation

I have developed this prototype [API developer area](http://elance.apievangelist.com/ "API developer area"), driven by the Elance community to show what is possible using the [Elance API.](http://www.elance.com/p/api "Elance API")

Using the power of the existing API developer community at [Elance](http://www.elance.com "Elance") you can quickly take your API beyond community and build a living [API ecosystem](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php "API Ecosystem").
