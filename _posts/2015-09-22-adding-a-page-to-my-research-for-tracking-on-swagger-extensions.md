[I have a research project dedicated to trying to understand al things Swagger.](http://swagger.apievangelist.com) I try to add any new research, or tooling there when I can. The latest thing I added was a page to list out Swagger extensions that I find in the wild.

[I knew Apigee has extended Swagger in some interesting ways](http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/12/crafting-exactly-the-api-definition-you-need-with-swagger-vendor-extensions/), but I was coming across other interesting examples, and want to try and aggregate into a single location, so that others can reference and build upon. 

[There is now an extensions page on my Swagger research](http://swagger.apievangelist.com/extensions/index.html). I have added [APIMATIC's x-codegen-settings](https://apimatic.io/blog/post/swagger-2-0-extension-for-code-generation-settings), a couple from Apigee to kick things off. If you know of any interesting examples of Swagger extension, please let me know via the [project's Github issues](https://github.com/kinlane/swagger/issues), or [feel free to fork the project and add to the extensions page using the \_config.yml file for the Github project](https://github.com/kinlane/swagger), they are stored as a YAML collection.

[Hopefully we can start centralizing all the innovative extensions of Swagger into a single location](http://swagger.apievangelist.com/extensions/index.html), helping us all not re-invent the wheel when it comes to extending the popular API definition format, affectionately known as Swagger.
