The Run in Postman has had a profound effect on the API space, and is [something we have long felt was in need of iteration and evolution](https://apievangelist.com/2020/12/05/expanding-the-vocabulary-for-run-in-postman-buttons/). The concept is something that is wider and more universal than just a collection, and can easily be applied to OpenAPI operations, as well as Arazzo workflows. One could also argue there is room in developer experience with actions involving overlays throughout the production and consumption of APIs, not just applying API resources. API Evangelist would like to see a modern interpretation of the Run in Postman, but what weâ€™d call a verb in noun API button (or some other combination), with some of the following characteristics.

- **Verbs** - Going well beyond running, and maintaining a rich suite of meaningful actions.
- **Nouns**  - Not limiting the nouns to a single provider and opening up to occurring anywhere.
- **OpenAPI**  - Centered around OpenAPI, Arrazzo, and Overlays, doubling down on OAI.
- **Portable**  - Forkable, executable, and shareable units of API value that can be exchanged.
- **Open Source**  - Openly licensed tooling that uses openly licensed machine-readable specs.
- **Live or Mock**  - All for trial and error without bringing down production, letting us all learn.
- **Analytics**  - Help producers and consumers understand the mechanics of what is happening.

The verb in noun API button should run in [Bump.sh](https://bit.ly/409FCkd), [Scalar](https://bit.ly/3DMAsCZ), and any other service or tool that we use. This is the point where people will point out that the future is AI agents. Maybe. Partially. However, We are not willing to cede agency to AI over giving it to the hoomans. AI agents will still need humans and we would rather equip the humans with the buttons they need to push, and they can decide which of those buttons trigger AI. Additionally the verbs and nouns associated with each individual API request or workflow trigger will provide a nice semantic buffet for AI agents to snack on, while also ensuring that humans can craft buttons for other humans that are meaningful and relevant in their work and lives.
