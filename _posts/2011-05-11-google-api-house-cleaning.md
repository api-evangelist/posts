Google has had a busy year when it comes to APIs. So far this year they've launched 6 new APIs:

*   [Tasks API](https://code.google.com/apis/tasks/index.html "Google Tasks API")
*   [Books API](https://code.google.com/apis/books/ "Google Books API")
*   [Pagespeed Online API](https://code.google.com/apis/pagespeedonline/index.html "Pagespeed Online API")
*   [Places API](https://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/places/ "Google Places API")
*   [Prediction API](https://code.google.com/apis/predict/ "Google Prediction API")
*   [Fusion Tables API](https://code.google.com/apis/fusiontables/ "Google Fusion Tables API")

As they add APIs to their directory they have also provided [Google Discovery Service](http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/ "Google Discovery Service") to help developers find APIs, [Google Explorer](http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/ "Google Explorer") to start working with APIs, and [Google Console](http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/ "Google Console") for developers to manage the APIs they integrate with.

With the addition of new APIs, some of the older APIs are rendered obsolete with new versions of the API, while others are just shutdown for not getting traction.

The following APIs are now deprecated but have no scheduled shutdown date:

*   Code Search API
*   Diacritize API
*   Feedburner APIs
*   Finance API
*   Power Meter API
*   Sidewiki API
*   Wave API

While these APIs will be shut down per the deprecation policies outlined in their documentation:

*   Blog Search API
*   Books Data API
*   Books JavaScript API
*   Image Search API
*   News Search API
*   Patent Search API
*   Safe Browsing API (v1 only)
*   Translate API
*   Transliterate API
*   Video Search API
*   Virtual Keyboard API

Google provides lengthy deprecation periods as long as 3 years in some cases, along with alternative APIs in other situations. The move is part of a larger effort to free up resources for other projects and make the overall Google API ecosystem a much more organized world.
