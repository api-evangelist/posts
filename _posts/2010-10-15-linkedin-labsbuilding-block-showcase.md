[LinkedIn](http://blog.linkedin.com/2010/10/13/linkedin-labs/) has released an API labs to showcase various internal projects using the LinkedIn API.

[LinkedIn Labs](http://www.linkedinlabs.com/) hosts a small set of projects and experimental features built by the employees of LinkedIn. They are published demonstrations and intended to be low-maintenance experiments and may be added and removed over time based on popularity and support.

Four projects the Labs showcases are:

*   [**NewIn**](http://www.linkedinlabs.com/newin) - This application shows new members joining LinkedIn from around the world.
*   [**ChromeIn**](http://www.linkedinlabs.com/chromein) - Integrate LinkedIn directly into Google Chrome. Easy access to your LinkedIn updates, anytime.
*   [**Instant Search**](http://www.linkedinlabs.com/instantsearch) - A sample application to search LinkedIn, built over the new Linkedin Javascript APIs.
*   [**Signal**](http://www.linkedinlabs.com/signal) - Signal is aimed at making it easy for all professionals to glean the most relevant insights from the never-ending stream of status updates and news.
An [API Labs](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=164) is a great way to showcase experimental and innovative projects that utilize your API.

Encouraging your internal staff to spend time on Labs projects and showcasing on site can improve internal understanding of challenges faced by developers when integrating with your API.
