I was taking another look at the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api) over the weekend, and thought their listing of API endpoints was pretty interesting. They provide two ways of looking at the platform APIs:

*   **API Section** - Listing of Reddit APIs by account, apps, links, listings, and other groupings.
*   **oAuth Scope -** Listing of Reddit APIs by the endpoints oAuth scope.

Not sure if it is something all APIs should follow, I just thought it was an interesting approach, something I haven’t seen in any other API area. Reddit has a number of APIs, I can see if you have specific goals with the API, this might be useful to have API sorted in this way.
