[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) was down for a little while today. I saw the status report and for some reason actually clicked through to the web page. I don’t actually use Heroku, so it doesn’t impact me directly, but I’m always curious.

I really like the [Heroku status and incident report site](https://status.heroku.com/). The site elegantly displays the last 30 days of status for the Heroku platform--complete with real-time notifications via email, SMS, Twitter, RSS and API.
