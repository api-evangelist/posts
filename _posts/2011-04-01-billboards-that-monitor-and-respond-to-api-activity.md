Its kind of goofy at first glance, but if you think about it...it is a pretty powerful application of an API.

[GranataPet](http://www.granatapet.de/), a German dog food manufacturer, created a [billboard that dispenses a treat for your dog when you check in to it using Foursquare](http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/03/31/api-highlight-a-special-for-our-four-legged-friends/).

Think about the possibilities when you have signs, billboards, and other types of display that either respond or dispense something when you interact via your mobile phone and an API.

Opens up a whole lot of possibilities when you have devices that monitor APIs for specific triggers, respond accordingly, and then developers build software on top of those APIs.
