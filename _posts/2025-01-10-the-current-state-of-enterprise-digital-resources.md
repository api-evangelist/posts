Your average enterprise organization has a sprawling and chaotic mix of application programming interfaces being produced and consumed, making business operations difficult to see, understand, and confidently move in any single direction, and always working to play catch up when it comes to technical debt.

  - We Produce a Lots of Internal Microservices
  - We Produce Many Shadow 1st-Party APIs
  - We Produce a Handful of 3rd-Party APIs
  - We Consume Many Different 3rd-party API
  - We Donâ€™t Use Infrastructure APIs to Automate

It is always interesting to hear API teams share with me how resource deficient they are when they have so many digital resources surrounding them, revealing just how much help your average enterprise needs when it comes to API education, collaboration, and observability, so they can better use what they already have.

This is part of ongoing series to aggregate all of the conversations we've had with enterprises about their APIs over the last five years into a single outline.
