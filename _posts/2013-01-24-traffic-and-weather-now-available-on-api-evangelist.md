I just added a new feature to the right hand menu, for the podcast [Traffic and Weather](http://trafficandweather.io/), a podcast about APIs and the cloud from John Sheehan ([@johnsheehan](https://twitter.com/johnsheehan)) and Steve Marx ([@smarx](https://twitter.com/smarx)).

I’m big podcast fan, and I"m always looking for something I can listen to in the background while I’m coding or writing stories.  Traffic and Weather is great for this.

The podcast dives into various topics ranging from Webhooks to oAuth, but keeps things light, where I think even non-technical folks can get up to speed on the latest in the space. John and Steve make things very informative, while being friendly and keeping it conversational.

I added a widget to my right hand menu, which will always pull the latest episode from Traffic and Weather. You can also click on the logo to go directly to their site.

Enjoy!
