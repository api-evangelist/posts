People are the most costly, messy, and valuable asset an enterprise possesses, and enterprise leadership is extremely focused on keeping the talent they have and empowering them to do more work over time with API integrations and automation—raising the stakes for getting all the API people moving in the same direction.

  - Embrace Federated Teams
  - Support With Centralized Teams
  - Active Embedded Champions
  - Clear API Product Ownership
  - Everyone Possesses API Skills
  - API Value Actively is Evangelized
