I’ve been doing lots of research into the [future of web APIs](/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/ "future of web APIs") lately, and one area that is definitely gaining more traction is the ability to automate tasks, by defining triggers and actions on top of web APIs.

If you’ve heard about API automation, it’s probably due to the attention [If This Then That (IFTTT)](http://ifttt.com/ "If This Then That") and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/ "Zapier") have been getting. While these are two of the most popular platforms currently, I wanted to dive in and understand the entire landscape.

Currently I’ve found 8 API automation platforms:

API automation platforms provide a new way for developers and non-developers to put API resources to use for business or personal tasks. These automation platforms provide a new opportunity for companies looking to deploy APIs, providing additional channels for distribution and user acquisition.

If you know of any API automation platforms I missed, let me know.
