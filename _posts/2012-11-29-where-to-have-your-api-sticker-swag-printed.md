Swag can be a critical tool in any API evangelist toolbox. And stickers are one piece of swag that if possessing the right design, can be something developers will take home and put to use.

Earlier today Ari Fuchs ([@arifuchs](https://twitter.com/arifuchs)), developer evangelist for [Aviary](http://www.aviary.com/) asked, “**_who do you use to print your sticker swag?_**”
