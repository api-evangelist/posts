I depend on [If This Then That (IFTTT)](https://ifttt.com/) to move data around the cloud.  I syndicate blog posts from [API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com) to Blogger and Tumblr.  This isn't just blind syndication, it is SEO and also plan B scenarios to make sure my content exists in multiple areas.

When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use.  If I begin to depend on an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS).  This is how I roll.

Not all platorms allow for this.  In my opinion, all FREE platforms should have [relief valves for users](http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/) like me, who want to move to some sort of paid account, assuring me some sort of service level agreement (SLA) or I'll move away.

For example: Once I started using Evernote regularly, I moved to the premium level.  I bought into Pinboard at an early rate, once I was hooked.  Inversely, I can't pay for Twitter, Facebook and some Google services.  Today it is about IFTT.

In light of me losing Google Reader I'm taking a hard look at all my services.  IFTT is on the chopping block.

I have about 20-30 jobs running at IFTTT, moving data around between my cloud services, in a way I depend on.  I need to move this into the realm of premium or paid services.  

What are your thoughts?  Sell me on your service.
