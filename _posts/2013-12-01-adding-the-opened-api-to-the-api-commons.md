We have added the [OpenEd API](http://www.opened.io/#/developer "OpenEd API") to the [API Commons](http://apicommons.org "API Commons"). OpenEd provides open educational resources like courses, videos and games for teachers to use in their classes.

Using the API, developers can read and write resources to the platform, which currently houses 250K openly licensed educational resources.

In addition to making all of the content openly licensed, the [OpenEd.io site is also open sourced on Github](https://github.com/openedinc/opened.io). Making the OpenEd API definition a perfect candidate for the API commons.

The [OpenEd team designed their API using Apiary.io](http://docs.opened.apiary.io/), defining it using API Blueprint, a [web API language that allows for the description of APIs using markdown](http://apiblueprint.com/).

OpenEd is a great open educational content API blueprint to follow, and we are honored to have it in the commons!
