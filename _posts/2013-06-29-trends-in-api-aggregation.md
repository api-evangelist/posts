One trend in API usage I'm closely watching is the [aggregation of APIs by a new wave of startups](http://aggregation.apievangelist.com "API Aggregation"). As the world adopts more cloud services, the need to aggregate content across multiple APIs is growing.

I'm currently tracking on [15 API aggregators](http://aggregation.apievangelist.com "API Aggregation"), who focus on bringing together data and content in 10 areas:

*   Analytics
*   Cloud Computing
*   Cloud Storage
*   Financial
*   Government
*   Invoicing
*   Messaging
*   Notifications
*   Personal
*   Social

The companies I'm watching on may provide other services, such as integration or automation between cloud services. However I focus on the aggregation of content and data, and the creation of new, aggregated APIs across multiple services.

Some comapnies also provide entirely new APIs with data, features and functionality that can only be uncovered by aggregating across multiple services.

In 2013 we will continue seeing API aggregation providers emerge, providing a new layer on top of the most popular API services that we are quickly growing dependent on.
