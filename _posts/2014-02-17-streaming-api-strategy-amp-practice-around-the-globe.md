At [API Strategy & Practice](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/ "API Strategy & Practice") in San Francisco last October, we streamed the event online. We are considering doing this again for [#APIStrat in Amsterdam this March 26-28th](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php).

We had an inquiry from Australia, asking whether or not we planned to do this for Amsterdam, and they wanted to stream some of the event as part of their local API meetup--what a great idea!

So we wanted to put out the word and see if there are other API meetup groups that were interested in doing the same thing in their local area. If you are interested in streaming the event go ahead and ping me on Twitter [@kinlane](https://twitter.com/kinlane) or email me at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#87eee9e1e8c7e6f7eee2f1e6e9e0e2ebeef4f3a9e4e8ea "info@apievangelist.com").

If we get enough groups signed up, we’ll make sure the stream is available for Amsterdam.
