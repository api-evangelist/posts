I spoke with Phil Windley ([@windley](https://twitter.com/windley)) over at [Brigham Young University (BYU)](http://byu.edu) about their API strategy this morning. BYU is bringing together API providers and consumers, to establish a coordinated strategy for delivering designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs across campus--an effort being led by [CIO Kelly Flannagan](http://cio.byu.edu/) ([@kelflanagan](https://twitter.com/kelflanagan)).

As part of their latest API effort, BYU is focusing in on the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to campus resources:

*   Students
*   Instructors
*   Classrooms
*   Classes
*   Courses

The API team is still struggling with a handful of technical details like how to deal with unique identifiers, and relationship between resources, but overall they are on a healthy path when it comes to getting their API designed, and deployed for use at the institution. I’m interested in seeing how fast they progress with a top down approach to APIs, vs the bottom up efforts I’m seeing at institutions like [UC Berkeley](https://developer.berkeley.edu/).

I will be talking their team regularly, about their design, deployment, management, and integration strategy. I want to make sure and document the process all along the way, and share real-time updates that other universities can follow along, or possibly collaborate with us when it comes to establishing some common API patterns we can share and re-use across higher educational institutions.

Look for any stories out of BYU, here on API Evangelist, or over at my [university API research site](http://university.apievangelist.com/), and if you are doing any API work at your school, I'd love to know more about it.
