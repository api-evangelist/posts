I had the pleasure of speaking at [API Days](http://apidays.io/ "API Days") in Paris, France this week. The organizers originally asked me to do one talk, but after some speaker shuffle, I ended up with three separate talks on APIs.

The second talk I did at API Days was [The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal](/talks/apidays/internal-apis/ "The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal").  This material was evolved from past stories I've done on [Amazon's](http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/ "Amazon") and [Netflix's](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/20/apis-power-netflix%E2%80%99s-move-to-cloud-enabling-world-domination/ "Netflix") success with internal APIs.  

I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs. But these are the hardest stories to come by, and I feel they are some of the most important API stories we can tell.  

If you have a great internal API story you'd like to tell, I love to hear more.  Feel free to email or DM on Twitter, and we can figure out the best format to tell your story.

You can view my presentation of [The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal](/talks/apidays/internal-apis/ "The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal") from [API Days](http://apidays.io/ "API Days"), and I believe the session was video taped, so I'm sure there will be videos coming soon!
