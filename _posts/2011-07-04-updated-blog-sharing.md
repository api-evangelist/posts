I updated the sharing tools on apievangelist.com today. Previously it had eight buttons, representing the top social network channels that drive traffic to the blog.

I'm changing it, putting emphasis on:

*   [Google +1](http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/ "Google +1")
*   [Twitter](http://twitter.com/about/resources/tweetbutton "Twitter Share Button")
*   [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/publishers "LinkedIn Share Button")

These are the topkinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.comPI Evangelist that drives traffic to the blog.

![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/secondary-share-buttons.png)I started by adding individual buttons from all the major providers:

*   [Facebook](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/# "Facebook Like Button")
*   [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/badges/ "StumbleUpon Share Button")
*   [Digg](http://about.digg.com/downloads/button/smart "Digg Share Button")
*   [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/buttons "Reddit Share Button")

At first I used [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/analytics "AddThis Sharing") for the whole share toolbar, but I couldn't get it to layout the way I wanted. So I used individual buttons from the Google +1, Twitter and LinkedIn, then I used AddThis for the other top providers:

*   Instapaper
*   Hacker News
*   DZone
*   Posterous
*   Tumblr
*   Reddit

I will be making some major updates to [kinlane.com](http://www.kinlane.com "kinlane.com") and using the same share strategy for the blog and web site. I'll keep adjusting to keep in line with top channels that drive traffic to my blogs.
