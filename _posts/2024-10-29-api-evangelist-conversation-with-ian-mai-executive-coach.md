My friend from Postman days [Ian Mai came by to talk about addiction and impulse control with me](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/sessions/2024-10-29-ian-mai-executive-coach.html). This isn't your average API conversation, but neither is my podcast, and I am all about sharing my own struggles, while also giving friends a platform to help others with their battles. I appreciate Ian's honesty in his own struggles with addiction and trying to find balance, and wanted to learn more about why he left Postman, and why he said he was leaving tech. I don't see Ian as leaving tech, I think he'll continue to help us all find our way, and be there for anyone who hits the wall or drives into the ditch, as most everyone will experience at one time or another. I always cherished Ian's energy, and think this is the perfect role for him and his boundless enthusiasm.

It is easy to snicker at these conversation in the tech sector, but when you are younger and just getting started you just can't see all the ways that life and your behavior will catch up with you. There is no way to prepare you for everything life is going to throw at you, your career, and your family along the way. I have worked hard to be my own coach over the years, and the API Evangelist blog, as well as my personal Kin Lane blog have played an outsized role in helping get me through some difficult times. I don't want people to think they can always do it on their own, and [after struggling for years with my partners son](http://dronerecovery.org/journal/a-drone-recovery-post-to-remember-the-kid/), I encourage you to reach out to people like Ian who can help physically, mentally, and spiritually. Thanks for joining me Ian -- look forward to checking in six months down the road.
