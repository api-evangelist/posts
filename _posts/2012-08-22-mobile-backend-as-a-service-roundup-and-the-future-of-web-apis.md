I’m continuing my [research into the future of web APis](/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/ "research into the future of web APIs"), and after watching leading [Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) provider Kinvey start building APIs into their platform](http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/03/rise-of-mobile-backend-as-a-service-mbaas-api-stacks/ "Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) provider Kinvey start building APIs into their platform"), I think MBaaS providers show a lot of potential for providing developers with quick access to API resources.

To help me monitor the MBaaS market I spent some time rounding up as many of the providers as I could, and so far I’ve found 24 of them:

This number of providers really shows a fast growing market of back-end tools to help developers rapidly build mobile applications. Most of these service providers focus on common use cases like data storage, push notifications and social integration. As these platforms mature it makes sense that will need to start offering more specialized resources.

While developers can go straight to API service providers on their own, since MBaaS providers are in the business of simplifying development for mobile application builders, it makes a lot of sense for them to start bundling common resources available via social, photo, productivity APIs and location data APIs.
