There are many approaches to building an API ecosystem. Some approach it more like building an API community, and others as growing an API ecosystem.

[Howard Liptzin](http://twitter.com/howardliptzin# "Howard Liptzin"), at Avatar Industries prefers a more [organic approach growing an API community](http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/ "organic approach to growing an API community"). In his own words:

> _What you'll want to do is to create the conditions for a community to form, thrive, produce and grow._

Liptzin emphasises gardening over engineering, not managing your community, more facilitate. Before you even start, Liptzin offers a little advice:

> _Make sure your API actually solves a problem that merits solving!_

Then Liptzin identifies five areas to address when growing your API ecosystem:

*   Creation
*   Activation
*   Retention
*   Productivity
*   Growth

It is great to see other API owners and evangelists share their philosophies and approach to growing their community.

I recommend reading Liptzin's full post, [Rainmaking via Developer Communities](http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/ "Rainmaking via Developer Communities").
