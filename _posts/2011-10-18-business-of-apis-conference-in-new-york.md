I am getting ready for the [Mashery](http://www.mashery.com "Mashery"), [Business of APIs Conference](http://apiconference.com/ "Business of APIs Conference") in New York tomorrow.

BAPI is in its 5th year of bringing together the big players in the API space, to talk about their companies API strategies, and their efforts to reinvent their businesses using APIs.

The Business of APIs San Francisco two weeks ago was a very rewarding experience, you can checkout my [wrap-up of the event](http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/10/06/business-of-apis-conference-in-san-francisco-wrapup/ "wrap-up for the event") for more details.

A couple of the companies talking, also spoke at BAPI in San Francisco, but they've invited a different person to give the talk, so there shouldn't be much redundancy.  

BAPI NYC is from 1:00PM – 6:00PM at the [Hudson Theatre](http://www.millenniumhotelnyc.com/hudson-theatre/ "Hudson Theatre") in New York. The [New York event](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025693905?ref=ebtn "New York event October 19th") is the second in the Business of APIs series, with the third in [London, October 25th](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025746061?ref=ebtn "London event October 25th").

[Registration](http://apiconference.com/register/ "Registration") is still open for NYC and London, I recommend getting over there.
