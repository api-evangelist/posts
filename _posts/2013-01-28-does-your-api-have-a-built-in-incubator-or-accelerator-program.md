API ecosystems are all about research & development, and an opportunity for incubating ideas and apps in a way that invites 3rd party developers and companies to develop innovative ways of using your company assets and resources. I’ve discussed [incubation within an API ecosystem before,](http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/) and how companies are not just identifying developer talent and the best apps, but actually investing in companies via their API.

A new example of this in action is Nike's launch of their [Nike+ Accelerator](http://nikeaccelerator.com/index.html)\--a partnership with [TechStars](http://www.techstars.com/ "Techstars") that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the [NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform](http://developer.nike.com/).

The 10 partner companies will be given the following:

*   $20,000
*   Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access
*   A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member
*   Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
*   Code and solution reviews during the program
*   Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community
*   Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley
*   Real Access to Decision Makers

Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.

As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem? And while I’m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?

Sounds kind of like a Reese's Peanut Butter commercial! :)
