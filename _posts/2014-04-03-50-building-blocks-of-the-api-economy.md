I spend a lot of time looking through the websites of API companies, trying to understand not just the way they do business, but their role in their overall industry, or possibly how they influence other industries.

I have been spending more time looking through the [payment API space](http://payments.apievangelist.com/index.html) lately, and recently pulled together a list of [key players](http://payments.apievangelist.com/companies.html) in this space, as well as the [common building blocks](http://payments.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html) being used across the sector.

Much like other significant areas of APIs like [cloud computing](http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/11/common-building-blocks-of-cloud-apis/), messaging, geo, and social, I can’t help but consider the impact these payment APIs will have across all business sectors, and our government.

The 50 building blocks I identified as part of my payment API research will not just be the essential components of the payment API space, but will ultimately be some of the building blocks of the [API economy](http://apievangelist.com/2010/09/25/the-api-economy/) itself--take a look.

One of these building blocks is the cloud, think about what you get when you take these API driven resources and combine them with the [common building blocks of cloud computing](http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/11/common-building-blocks-of-cloud-apis/)? You start seeing being able to see the moving parts of the API economy.

I'm going to work to continue defining the other cornerstone areas I list in the history of APIs, like commerce, social, and mobile, and try to map out the building blocks like have with [payments](http://payments.apievangelist.com/) and [cloud computing](http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/11/common-building-blocks-of-cloud-apis/)\--see what I can learn.
