_This post comes from the [SDK Bridge](http://sdkbridge.com/ "SDK Bridge") newsletter.  I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you._

I recently received an email with the subject "FW: boring job". It was a long email chain that started with someone casting about for someone to write API documentation. It got me thinking about how most developers must wonder _why on earth_ someone with the skills to program would choose to write API documentation instead.

"Why" is a good question to ask yourself when starting up a new year. In fact, I recently saw a [TED talk video by Simon Sinek](http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/r/) on how the most effective people, companies, and organizations, start by thinking about _why_ they do something instead of _what_. In the video, Sinek brings up examples like Apple, the Wright Brothers, and even Martin Luther King, whose most famous speech began with "I have a dream" (why) and not "I have a plan" (what).

In this newsletter, I'll talk about why we write API documentation, from how it impacts the world to how it challenges us personally. But first, here's what SDK Bridge been up to since our last newsletter:

*   Writing C++ documentation for software embedded into agricultural vehicles.
*   Writing REST documentation for a company that creates software for governments.
*   Writing REST documentation based on [OpenSocial](http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/y/) to be able to create and manage online meetings.
*   Writing IT documentation for [Microsoft HealthVault](http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/j/).
