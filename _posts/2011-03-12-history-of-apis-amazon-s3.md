In March 2006, Amazon launched a groundbreaking web service that marked a significant departure from its traditional e-commerce platform. This new initiative was a storage web service called Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). Amazon S3 offers a straightforward interface that enables users to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It provides developers with access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, and cost-effective data storage infrastructure that Amazon utilizes to operate its global network of websites.

Amazon S3 was initially introduced solely as an API without any web interface or mobile application. It functioned as a RESTful API, supporting PUT and GET requests to handle objects or files. Developers leveraging the Amazon S3 API were charged $0.15 per gigabyte per month for storing files in the cloud. This innovative API and billing model paved the way for a new era of computing, now widely recognized as cloud computing. It also demonstrated that APIs were no longer limited to data exchange or basic functionality but could be employed to deliver scalable computing infrastructure.
