I am going through each of my research projects, and tightening things down, now that I have them all driven through my new, [master stack of APIs](https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html). First up was [API design](http://design.apievangelist.com), and [the other day I spent time going through the organization I track on as part of my API design research](http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/30/tightening-up-the-organizations-that-are-included-in-my-api-design-research/), and today mission was to refine the [tooling section](http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html).

Previously my tooling page was just an alphabetical list of tools, and I wanted to at least group things in a more meaningful way, reflecting how I break them down in my own monitoring system. So I reworked the publishing to allow me to group the tools by tags, resulting in the following list:
