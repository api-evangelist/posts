[Backend as a Service](/trends/baas.php "BaaS") (BaaS), sometimes called Mobile Backend is a Service (MBaaS) is a growing trend I’m monitoring at API Evangelist. I’m tracking on 20 providers in the space, with two newly added open-source BaaS platforms.

Beyond the research, stories and analysis on BaaS, I just added a [BaaS panel at the API Strategy & Practice Conference in New York City, February 21st and 22nd](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013/01/18/new-panel-at-apistrat-backend-as-a-service/). The panel will include six of the leading BaaS platforms:

*   Marc Weil ([@marcweil](https://twitter.com/marcweil)) of [Cloudmine](https://cloudmine.me/)
*   James Tamplin ([@jamestamplin](https://twitter.com/jamestamplin)) of [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
*   Miko Matasumura ([@mikojava](https://twitter.com/mikojava)) of [Kii](http://kii.com/)
*   Morgan Bickle ([@morganbickle](https://twitter.com/morganbickle)) of [Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com/)
*   Ilya Sukhar ([@ilyasu](https://twitter.com/ilyasu)) of [Parse](http://www.parse.com/)
*   Ty Amell ([@tyamell](https://twitter.com/tyamell)) of [StackMob](https://www.stackmob.com/)

API play a critical role in BaaS platforms by providing interfaces for the common services emerging in the BaaS space, like object storage, user management and location, to name a few, but also bring in other 3rd party services like Twitter and Facebook.

I will be moderating this new BaaS panel at APIStrat. Let me know if there are any questions about the space, you’d like me to ask.
