If you've met me in person, you know I always wear my logo on my t-shirt.  I'm not a graphic designer, and when I needed a logo for [API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com), I just wrapped the words in JSON and called it good.  It has stuck.  

When I was in France speaking at [API Days](http://apidays.io), the art director at [faberNovel](http://www.fabernovel.com/en/) drew some [very cool sketches of me](/2012/12/10/api-evangelist-drawings/).  He recently followed up with some more high resolution images I can use for t-shirts.

Very cool! Thank you so much Benoit Talabot and [faberNovel](http://www.fabernovel.com/en/)!  I'm working on ordering some t-shirts using the work, right now on Inkd.
