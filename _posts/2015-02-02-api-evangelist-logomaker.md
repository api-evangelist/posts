In 2010, when I started API Evangelist, I sat down to create a logo, and after six hours of frustration in photoshop, I eventually just typed out my logo as a basic JSON representation, kind of as a joke, which I eventually planned on changing, but it stuck.

With the latest batch of t-shirts I've ditched the "logo" portion, but will keep this legacy version floating around, here and there for nostalgic purposes. Along the way, I've added what I consider the function version of the logo, which I use for each of my research sites.

I'm starting so many new research areas lately, I decided to create a logomaker API, so I can make new logos, and anyone else can make their own as well. There are three API endpoints for the [API Evangelist logomaker API](http://logomaker.apievangelist.com/):

*   **Single** - [http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=\[value\]](http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=[value])
*   **Key/Value** - [http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/keyvalue/?key=\[key\]&value=\[value\]](http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/keyvalue/?key=[key]&value=[value])
*   **Function** - [http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/function/?name=\[name\]](http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/function/?name=[name])

The API is completely open, but I will be cleaning out the images each day, so if you truly want to keep one, save it locally. Have fun playing. I will actually be using it to generate headers for my research sites. If you want to use any of my logos, make sure you follow my [branding guidelines](http://apievangelist.com/branding-guidelines.html). ;-)
