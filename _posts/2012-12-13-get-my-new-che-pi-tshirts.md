While I was in France, the art director at [Faber Novel](http://www.fabernovel.com/en/) did some cool sketches of me.  Since I'm so graphically challenged (see my logo), I'm stoked to have the artwork to work with.

I've been playing around with different versions of it, combine with different messages.  Here is my first one.

[You can get your own at Custom Ink](http://www.customink.com/designs/chepi/ebq0-000s-tdtd/hotlink?pc=HL-76684&cm_mmc=hotlink-_-3-_-Header_txt-_-prehead1).  When I find a design I like, I will get quantities printed, so they are cheaper.  But for now they are $26.95 a pop.
