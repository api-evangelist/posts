Here is a video of one of my talks fromÂ [API Days in Paris](http://apidays.io/ "API Days"), France where I walked the internal side of APIs. This talk is derived from my post, [the secret to amazons success is internal](http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/lessons-in-api-deployment-from-netflix/ "the secret to amazons success is internal") and stories I've written on [Netflix's success with internal APIs](http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/lessons-in-api-deployment-from-netflix/ "Netflix's success with internal APIs").

The presentation for this talk is available in my talks section at [The Secret to a Successful ApI is Internal](/talks/apidays/internal-apis).

You can find another video from API Days by me called [Business Models For Your API as Startup from API Days](/2012/12/20/business-models-for-your-api-as-startup-from-api-days/), in a nearlier post.
