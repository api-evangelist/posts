In my [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/ "Google Reader") I curate hundreds of articles pulled from 600+ blogs and 25+ real-time Google Alerts, on a daily basis. Everything I star in my Google Reader or Tweet about daily ends up in my [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/ "Pinboard") account. In addition to this curation, I bookmark every relevant site and post I come across in my daily surfing using the Pinboard bookmarklet.

Using the [Pinboard API](http://pinboard.in/api/ "Pinboard API") I setup a news curation system at [API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com "API Evangelist") which pulls my latest pinboards every 15 minutes and adds them to a curation queue which I monitor every couple hours. My API Evangelist curation system allows me to add comments and tags, further adding meaning to what I’ve already read throughout the day. Then using a combinations of tags, I route relevant news to  [API Evangelist](/news/ "API Evangelist") and [Hack Weekends](http://www.hackweekends.com/news/ "Hack Weekend News").

These curated links represent the daily reading and research that goes into my writing and industry reports. I thought it would be good to share with you some of what I read on a daily basis, my random comments and insights, rather than just the final results.
