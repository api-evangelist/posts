We just added [three new speakers to the lineup for @APIStrat Berlin this April 24th and 25th](http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/picking-up-momentum-in-2015-for-apistrat-berlin-with-3-new-speakers/). I get pretty excited about this part of the event planning lifecycle, which is all about reviewing talks that being submitted, and working with the rest of the APIStrat, and now the API Days team, to develop the best lineup possible.

Here are the three that we added today:

These three speakers represent APIs and the music industry, project collaboration, and 3D printing—which I think is a pretty nice representation of how APIs are making an impact in 2015.

If you haven’t submitted a talk, make sure and head over to the [APIStrat call for talks page](http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/call-for-talks/), and make sure you are part of the lineup in Berlin, this April—we will be closing the call for talks soon, so make sure you do it quick!
