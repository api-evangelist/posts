Twilio just made their first move into Europe by offering [Twilio Voice service in the United Kingdom](http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/10/twilio-launches-in-europe-opens-office-london.html "Twilio Voice Service in the United Kingdom").

The [Twilio Voice API](http://www.twilio.com/api/voice "Twilio Voice API") is now available in the UK, allowing developers to launch local phone numbers in the country. Â Along with the release Twilio has announced the opening of their first international office based in East London.

The UK launch is the first to go live of five countries currently in Beta including France, Poland, Austria, Denmark and Portugal with several more countries on the way.

Twilio's APIs have proven a favorite of developers, and fast becoming an essential cloud computing service for applications.

The move into Europe will only grow their developer base and the number of applications using the cloud telephony API. Something that traditional telcos should take notice of.
