I've created a new playground for some of my work. Pretty much everything at [API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com "API Evangelist") runs on Github, and each new project I produce starts its life as a Github repository. To support this work I established a new domain called ongithub.

My first series in the ongithub realm is based upon an approach I'm using to deploy very simple APIs, while also introducing and educating people about APIs. I have a handful of simple API designs from working in the government, so I married them with data models derived from [schema.org](http://schema.org), and publish over 10 very simple API design patterns.

Every one of these demo APIs began as a simple [Swagger specification](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/ "swagger"), which I quickly spun into a web API using the [Slim REST Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/ "SLIM REST Framework"), then generated a simple API microsite complete with interactive documentation.

These Swagger specifications were the seed of the recent [API Commons that 3Scale and API Evangelist just launched](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/3scale-launches-api-commons-to-allow-developers-to-share-apis-under-creative-commons-licenses/). I have plenty of other API designs laying around, but this seemed like a good way to seed the [API Commons](http://apicommons.org "API Commons") with some simple and common designs.

You can find the following 11 designs at [api.ongithub.com](http://api.ongithub.com "api.ongithub.com"):

If there are any API designs you'd like to see published to api.ongithub.com, let me know. If you'd prefer a Ruby, Python or Node.js API backend, also let me know.

I will be playing with as many API design patterns here as I can fit in. I encourage you to fork any of my work and make sure to submit any of your own work to API Commons. If you have a design you think would fit in well with api.ongithub.com let me know, and I am happy to list.
