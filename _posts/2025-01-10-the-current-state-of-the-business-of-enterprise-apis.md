Almost everyone involved with APIs in the enterprise is focused exclusively on the direct monetization of API resources, with very few actually doing anything to standardize this work across all internal and external APIs, and always lack a balanced understanding of what direct and indirect API value generation means.

  - No Actively Managed Plan for API Access
  - Only Minimal Metering of API Usage
  - Only Minimal Reporting of API Usage
  - No Regular Invoicing of API Consumption
  - The Direct Revenue of APIs is Unknown

All API consumption should be measured and invoiced upon even if a payment is ever received. There is a growing enterprise appetite for justifying the return on API investment over the last decade, but few have been actively metering, invoking, and reporting to understand what is, let alone what will be or mean.
