When I am learning any new specification, I always look for the JSON Schema behind it. This essential artifact is your map to any schema or specification. It is the truth. It is what will validate your work as you are fumbling your way through learning the properties and shape of any specification and schema. As I dive into better understanding where the Arazzo specification fits into my APIs.json, OpenAPI, and JSON Schema driven world, I immediately go looking for the [JSON Schema for the Arazzo](https://github.com/OAI/Arazzo-Specification/tree/v1.0.0-dev/schemas/v1.0).

What I like about what the Arazzo contributors (I see you Jeremy, Henry, and Jason) did is that they included a [JSON and a YAML JSON Schema for the Arazzo specification](https://github.com/OAI/Arazzo-Specification/tree/v1.0.0-dev/schemas/v1.0). It is something that will confuse many, upset a few, but ultimately reflects my YAML during design and development, and JSON during build and runtime philosophy. I am writing this post just to bookmark the schema in case I forget where it is, adding it to memory (apievangelist.com)-—if it isn’t here it doesn’t exist.
