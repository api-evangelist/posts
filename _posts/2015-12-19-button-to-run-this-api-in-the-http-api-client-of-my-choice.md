There are more [HTTP client tools](http://client.apievangelist.com/companies.html) out there than I can shake a stick at (I've reached that point, I'm shaking sticks at things), and in 2016 I predict there will be even more entrants into the space. [I'd say Postman was a pioneering force in the evolution of the HTTP client when it comes for web API space](http://apis.how/gwbjyujag1), but is [something that it is beginning to collide with API design tooling from Apiary](http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0), as well as being [morphed by new players like Stoplight.io](http://apis.how/syulwzictt).

Maybe I am playing with more of these environments than the average API consumer is, because of what I do for a living, but I have to say, I am getting tired of "importing" my API definitions. Don't me wrong. I am stoked that all tools support the importing of [machine readable API definitions like OADF, and API Blueprint](http://definitions.apievangelist.com/), but I cannot help always looking to what should be next, and I want to be able to just run each API, in my HTTP client of my choice.

[For all of my own APIs, I provide a Postman icon, and link to a Postman Collection](https://kin-lane.github.io/api/). It just gives you quick access to the machine readable currency that all services I depend on speak, OADF, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection. However, I still have to import it into Postman, or other HTTP API client, or service I will be using. While this is a good start, and is something I recommend other API providers do, I think we can still do better.

If you are operating one of the HTTP API clients, or [planning one of the next generation API cleints, tools, garage, hub, playground, studio, workbench, or builder](http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/04/api-client-tool-garage-hub-playground-studio-workbench-and-builders/), can you please provide a "run in XXXX" embeddable button please? I would like to see pretty little icons throughout API portals, and the service providers we depend on across the API space, that empower me run any API via the client I depend on every day.

Think the Twitter and Facebook share buttons, but for API integration, and the currency is OADF and API Blueprint definitions. I appreciate all you HTTP API client providers considering my crazy requests. If done right, I think it could result in some potential new users, depending how you'd handle the process for users who clicked, but didn't actually have an account with your platform yet--anyway, food for thought. #onward
