There is a [new API edition to the healthcare industry](http://www.lifeimage.com/landing/api "new API edition to the healthcare industyr") this week. lifeIMAGE launched an API that can be used by developers of healthcare applications, to enable the secure exchange of medical images and related patient records.

Norman Young, President and CEO of ClearCanvas, said _“We were founded on the simple belief that medical imaging informatics should be accessible to all. Now, using the lifeIMAGE API, users of our FDA-cleared diagnostic viewer will be able to instantaneously share images that are in front of them with any one.”_

The healthcare is industry that is ripe for API adoption, so I’m always looking for “healthy” new API stories for the space--[lifeImage API](http://www.lifeimage.com/landing/api "lifeimage API") is perfect. You can find out more about the API at www.lifeimage.com/api.
