In 2015, I will enter the 5th year of API Evangelist. To quote one of my favorite bands--“What a Long Strange Trip Its Been”. I couldn’t be more thankful for the career choice I made in 2010, and extremely grateful for the partners, and loyal readers I’ve established along the way.

This list is very long, but I have to [specifically call out 3Scale](http://3scale.net), and their support of what I do, without them API Evangelist wouldn’t be happening, I wouldn’t be doing my research, and open projects like [APIs.json](http://apisjson.org), and [API Commons](http://apicommons.org) wouldn’t exist—additionally we wouldn’t be having the [@APIStrat](https://twitter.com/apistrat) conversation that 3Scale makes happen.

I’m not a big year end wrap-up or predictor type of guy, but this doesn’t mean I do not spend a lot of time reflecting this time of year. I honestly don’t feel like anything has changed for me, I’m just as dedicated to my API Evangelist in 2015 as I ever have, and here is what I’m focusing on:

*   **Storytelling** - Telling stories on my blogs about what the smartest people in the space are doing with APIs.
*   **Research** - Researching how APIs are impacting a variety of industries, government, and even our personal world.
*   **Universities** - I am convinced that the next generation workforce needs to be digitally literate to be successful.
*   **APIStrat & API Days** - Helping facilitate the important tech, business, and political conversations that happen at [APIStrat](http://apistrat.com/) & [API Days](http://www.apidays.io/).
*   **APIs.json** - Encourage the use of APIs.json to assist in API discovery, and enable the assembling of the next generation API stacks.

While there is a lot more going on, this is my primary focus, and what you will find me doing most of the time in 2015. I will be seriously cutting back my travel, to focus on my research and storytelling. You can find me at APIStrat and API Days events, and at [Defrag](http://www.defragcon.com/) and [Gluecon](http://www.gluecon.com/), but beyond that I feel the biggest impact I make is keeping up with the space, telling stories, and publishing research that folks can use.

When it comes to predictions, I’m in alignment with 3Scale (once again). I think [their list of 2015 API predictions](http://www.3scale.net/2015/01/api-predictions-2015/) is very pragmatic, and provides a healthy view of what 2015 will look, where the most important thing that happens this year, is the steady, healthy growth of the API sector.
