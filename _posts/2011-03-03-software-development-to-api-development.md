In the last 20 years we've seen the how the Internet has altered the role of the developer from a desktop software developer to a[web application](http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/) developer.

It started with web sites, the need for talented graphic designers who could also assemble some HTML to deliver static web sites.

With languages like [VBScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript "VBScript"), [JavaScript](http://www.kinlane.com/category/javascript/), and Coldfusion, websites began evolving into Web applications, requiring developers to master more dynamic Web programming lanugages.

Then smart phones began making the Internet [mobile](http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/) and pushing developers to start programming for platforms like [IPhone](http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/) and [Android](http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/android/).

The next phase: **_the API developer_**.

Companies like [Clearcode in the UK](http://clearcode.cc/offer/api/ "Clearcode API Design") are beginning to offer [API design and development](http://clearcode.cc/offer/api/ "API Design and Development") services in order to meet the increasing demand for well-designed [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer "Representational State Transfer") Web APIs.

A whole new generation of developers will evolve to support the growing [API economy](http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/ "API Economy").
