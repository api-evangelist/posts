[Pingdom](http://www.pingdom.com/) is a Software as a Service(SaaS) that provides [website monitoring and up-time reporting](http://www.pingdom.com/).

Recently they started [offering public report pages](http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/02/08/new-public-report-from-pingdom-enters-beta/). These reports or status pages allows you to make some or all of your monitoring results public, promoting transparency with your users.

kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com These status pages can easily be converted to deliver an [API](http://www.apievangelist.com/) status page for your developer community. Pingdom provides HTTP and Custom HTTP monitoring that gives you enough tools to monitor a RESTful API and provide reporting.

Since the public reports are hosted at Pingdom, they will be available even when your own website is down.

In addition to a basic up and down status dashboard, Pingdom also provides visual charts and graphs:

*   Uptime and response time charts.
*   Response time global map.
kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com*   Daily and monthly overviews.
*   Customizable history (how far back in time the reports go).
*   Customizable design (colors, logo).

The charts are built using HTML, [CSS](http://www.kinlane.com/category/css/) and [JavaScript](http://www.kinlane.com/category/javascript/) (to avoid flash), so they work across browsers and on [IPhone](http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/), [IPad](http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/ipad/) and other mobile devices.

Pingdom provides a basic and business account, both with a 30 day trial period. One more ready-to-go API building block to deliver your [API Community](http://www.apievangelist.com/).
