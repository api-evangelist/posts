[PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) is an e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. PayPal serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods such as checks and money orders.

[Paypal offers a RESTful API](https://developer.paypal.com/) using a credential / signature authentication. Paypal provide a read / write API for payment transactions. Paypal includes software development kits (SDK) in PHP, Java, and .NET.

Paypal provides a large number of tools for its API. However, this information is spread across several areas making it difficult to find all of it.
