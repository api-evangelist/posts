[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Twilio.PNG)](http://www.twilio.com)The cloud communications platform [Twilio has a new API developer contest this week](http://blog.twilio.com/2011/02/anything-goes-developers-on-a-bus.html).

As usual they are looking for someone to build a killer app that uses the Twilio voice and SMS API.

This round they are looking for more, but first lets set the stage with the prizes:

*   A guaranteed seat on either the Cleveland, or Miami SXSW Startup Bus
*   A ticket to [SXSW Interactive](http://sxsw.com/interactive), valued at $750

In addition to building a killer app, they are looking for someone to tweet, blog, record video, and generally represent Twilio on the bus.

Entries must be [submitted](http://contests.twilio.com/submit-your-twilio-project.html) by 11:59pm PT on Sunday February 27th.
