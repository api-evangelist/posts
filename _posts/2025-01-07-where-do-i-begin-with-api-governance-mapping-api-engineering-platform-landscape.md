This is where we move from the current state of where to start with API governance to beginning to shape what the future state will look like. This is about mapping out the engineering platform, real or desired, which will provide the guard rails for teams who are producing APIs, and eventually the consumers who are putting those APIs to work in applications and integrations. The API engineering platform landscape map is about documenting the common resources that will be provided to teams in a centralized or federated manner.

  - **Frameworks** - The language frameworks for helping teams deliver APIs.
  - **Source Control** - What the source of truth will be for API artifacts and instances.
  - **Pipelines** - What CI/CD is available for making the API lifecycle a repeatable process.
  - **Gateways** - What gateway(s) are available for teams to publish their APIs to.
  - **Authentication** - What authentication methods are available for teams to employ.
  - **Analytics** - What metrics, analytics, reports, and dashboards are available to teams.
  - **Observability** - How are APIs made more observable in development and production.
  - **Traceability** - What is available to make API usage and debugging more traceable.

There is always more that you can do for teams to guide them forward across the API lifecycle, but this is where you start with governance, which with the right engineering platform, is just guidance and guardrails. The API engineering platform landscape map should provide the buffet menu that teams can use to keep them focusing on building what matters most within their domain, and not reinventing the wheel when it comes to all of the most common aspects of delivering and sustaining APIs at scale.
