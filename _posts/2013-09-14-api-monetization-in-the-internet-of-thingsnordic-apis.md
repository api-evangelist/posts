I have a panel this week at [Nordic APIs](http://nordicapis.com/events/stockholm-sep-2013/) called Business Models in an Internet of Things, with Ellen Sundh ([@ellensundh](https://twitter.com/ellensundh)) of [Coda Collective](http://codacollective.com/), David Henricson Briggs of [Playback Energy](http://www.playbackenergy.se/), Bradford Stephens of [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/) and Ronnie Mitra([@mitraman/a>) of](https://twitter.com/mitraman) [Layer 7 Technologies](http://www.layer7tech.com/). My current abstract for the panel is:
