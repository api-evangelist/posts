kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape/mashape-manage-your-APIs.png)Mashape[released a few enhancements](http://blog.mashape.com/introducing-some-new-things-inbox-new-wizard "released a few new enhancements") to their API management platform.

*   **Inbox** - Mashape redesigned their inbox and messaging system. Developers can contact you from your API detail page, and the inbox provides interface for managing developers and your conversations.
*   **API Wizard** - The API setup and management wizard is no longer a step by step wizard. It now gives you five options in a left hand navigation, leaving the room for more options to be added in the future.
*   **Private APIs** - You can now deploy a private API with Mashape, only inviting the developers you want to have access.

Some small changes, but prettyimportantchanges for API owners and developers who use [Mashape](http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/04/mashape-api-service-provider/ "Mashape").

I would say the ability to deploy a private API is the most significant, as more people realize the value of APIs, and deploy them for partners, not the general public.
