I tag a lot of interesting companies that show up during my weekly API monitoring. When I see a tag go from 1 or 2, to over 5 companies--I take a closer look to see what is going on. An increase in the number of companies focusing in a specific area could be a trend, or it could be nothing.

The tag "API Agency" ticked over to 6 today, when I added [Aquevix](http://www.aquevix.com/), an indian company that is focusing on API development. As of August 2014 I now have six separate agency style companies that I've found who have a focus on API design and development:

Developer Support Beyond FAQ, Forums and Documentation. First class support for your API. Processing an API request often means directly or indirectly interacting with 2 or more systems. Is your support team equipped with the necessary training, tools, information and support infrastructure to be successful?

We'll see how many more dev shops I find in the next couple months. Sometimes when I start focusing in a new area I will find more companies working in the same area, purely because I'm looking harder, and sometimes it takes time for things to actually heat up.

As I'm looking at local Chicago web and mobile development shops during the lead up to [API Strategy & Practce in Chicago](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php) next month, and I'm learning that many small shops like [SYDCON](http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/) and [Blaze Portfolio](http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/) are using APIs, they just havn't shifted their marketing and web site content to reflect the evolution.

It won't take much for many of these web and mobile development shops to standardize their API design and development services, much like the evolution we saw occur from web to mobile development, shifting the focus of the small dev shop to better serve a growing demand for API design, and development. I think by 2015 I'll see over 50 development shops, who are heavily focused on API design and developmennt in my API tracking system.

_**P.S.** I REALLY like the API Chappies, and Mike @ Stateless is the freak'n man!_
