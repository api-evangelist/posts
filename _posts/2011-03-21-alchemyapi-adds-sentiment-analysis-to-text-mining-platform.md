[AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com/ "Alchemy API"), a [natural language processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing") service announced a new [sentiment analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis "Sentiment analysis") layer to its existing text-mining Software as a Service (SaaS).

The service can be used by online publishers, news aggregators, and [contextualadvertising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_advertising "Contextual advertising") firms to understand and monetize online content.

The cloud-based text mining platform provides document-level, entity-level, and keyword level sentiment ming, in addition to support for negation handling, sentiment amplifiers or diminishers, slang and typos.

These features make the text mining API usable for analyzing and understanding user-generated social media content as well as editorialized text.

Sentiment analysis is available immediately to all AlchemyAPI users, more information is available at the [AlchemyAPI web site](http://www.alchemyapi.com/ "AlchemyAPI Website").
