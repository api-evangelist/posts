Few in the enterprise care about APIs, but everyone cares about the experience of running the enterprise and its applications and integrations via a sub-optimal API experience, and enterprise leadership has some pretty clear desires when it comes to improving the human experience that happens across API operations.

  - APIs Are Easier to Find
  - APIs Are Easier to Use
  - APIs Generate New Revenue
  - Optimize API Operating Costs
  - APIs Are Reliable and Trustworthy
  - We All Treat APIs as Products

The human experience of discovering, accessing, onboarding with APIs, and ensuring they are trustworthy, reliable, and affordable to produce and consume is top of mind for enterprise leadership, and it is something that is impacting every aspect of the enterprise, setting the stage for the stone business outside the firewall.
