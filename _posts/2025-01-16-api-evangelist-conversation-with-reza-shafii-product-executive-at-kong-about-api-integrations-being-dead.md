My friend [Emmanuel Paraskakis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuelparaskakis/) had [tagged me in one of Reza's posts on LinkedIn about API integrations being dead](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282033187784957954?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7282033187784957954%2C7282547041770086400%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287282547041770086400%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7282033187784957954%29), so I invitied Reza to come over and explain more about what he meant. I knew the title was bait, but I was interested in hearing Reza's argument and after the conversation it is clear that he's done a lot of thinking at this intersection and wasn't just adding to the AI hype. It was interesting to hear the reasoning for signalling a shift in how we see and abstract away the work APIs are doing, and it was validating to hear that governance will play an important role in KILLING API integrations.

It was a good thing that Emmanuel tagged us on the post. We tend to not dig into bait titles, but were happy to learn there was some logic to Reza's post. It is interesting and useful to think of the usage of "XXXXX is dead" as simply a signalling in the shift of how we abstract away things with technology. APIs are almost always abstracted away behind their applications, and signalling the shift to cloud, to AI, and whatever the next abstraction is can play an important role in understanding where things might be headed, and the stories people are telling about the journey.
