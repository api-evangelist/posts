If you aren’t already familiar with [Traffic and Weather](http://trafficandweather.io/), it is an extremely structured discussion between **[John Sheehan](http://twitter.com/johnsheehan)** ([Runscope](https://www.runscope.com/)) and **[Steve Marx](http://twitter.com/smarx)** ([Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers)), about "the latest API and cloud tools, news and technologies”.

Its not often I learn something new from the show (kidding), but today I learned about two new things:

[**Flask RESTful**](http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) \- Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. It is a lightweight abstraction that works with your existing ORM/libraries. Flask-RESTful encourages best practices with minimal setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTful should be easy to pick up.

[**Flynn**](https://flynn.io/) - Flynn simplifies deploying and maintaining applications. Instead of using complex configuration management systems, Flynn allows self-serve management of containerized deployments, making life easier for ops and developers.

Its nice to hear more discussion about the evolution of deploying API resources and micro services, and the [use of virtual containers from Docker, OpenShift and Cloud Formations](http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/)—especially since its a topic [Traffic and Weather and API Evangelist have discussed before](http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather--virtualized-api-stacks/). ;-)

Seriously though, they put on a good show, forward thinking API conversation, with lots of humor and not-so-funny humor mixed in. I always recommend listening when you have time, you might learn a thing or two about APIs along the way. 

_Tip: If it sounds like the show is almost over, it is. Turn off the podcast._
