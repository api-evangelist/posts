[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com "Twitter") has launched a new building block for their API community, a [YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/twitterapi/ "Twitter API Youtube Channel").

The new [YouTube Twitter API channel](http://www.youtube.com/twitterapi/ "YouTube Twitter API Channel") will contain interviews, tutorials and other video content that is produced in support of the [Twitter API](http://www.apievangelist.com/api-detail.php?API_ID=1831 "Twitter API").

Its a great idea. Perfect way to organize videos and presentations in a central location, as they are produced. Then users can come back at anytime and learn.

A YouTube channel for an API community could also be a great way to build community, by soliciting feedback on what type of content users want to see, or even accept submissions from your developers.

I added a [YouTube channel](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=157 "Youtube channel to my list of innovative building blocks") to my list of [building blocks](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php "building blocks") that API owners are using.
