I am regularly reminded in my world as the API Evangelist that things are rarely ever what they seem on the surface. Meaning that what a company actually does, and what a company says it does are rarely in sync. This is one of the reasons I like APIs, [is they often give a more honest look at what a company does (or does not do)](http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/03/apis-can-give-an-honest-view-of-what-a-company-does/), potentially cutting through the bullshit of marketing.

It would be nice if companies were straight up about their intentions, and relied upon building better products, offering more valuable services, but many companies prefer being aggressive, misleading their customers, and in some cases an entire industry. I'm reminded of this fact once again while reading a post on [software backward compatibility, undocumented APIs and importance of history](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1136184/Software-backward-compatibility-undocumented-APIs), which provided a stark example of it in action from the past:

“**Embrace, extend, and extinguish**“,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#cite_note-DeadlyEmbrace-1) also known as “**Embrace, extend, and exterminate**“,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#cite_note-2) is a phrase that the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice) found[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#cite_note-3) that was used internally by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#cite_note-4) to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) capabilities, and then using those differences to disadvantage its competitors.

This behavior is one of the contributing factors to why the most recent generation(s) of developers are so adverse to standards and is behavior that exists within current open API and open source efforts. From experience, I would emphasize that the more a company feels the need to say they are open source, or open API, the more likely they are indulging in this type of behavior. It is like, some sort of subconscious response, like the dishonest person needing to state that they are being honest, or that you need to believe them--we are open, trust us.

I am not writing this post as some attempt to remind us that Microsoft is bad--this isn't at all about Microsoft. It is simply to remind us that this behavior has existed in the past, and it exists right now. Not all companies involved in helping define the API space are not interested in things being open, and that there are common specifications in place for us all to use. Some companies are more interested in slowing what happens within the community, and ensuring that when possible, all roads lead to their proprietary solution. This is just my regular reminder to always be aware.
