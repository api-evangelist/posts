The current state of technology within these enterprises is almost always the same, with well-meaning and smart people working hard over the years to deliver what is needed within any given moment, but have also picked their head up to realize that this work isn’t sustainable, and needs help getting back on track.

  - There Are Many Different Types of APIs
  - There Are Many Backend Systems
  - There Are Many Different Protocols
  - An Assortment of API Gateways
  - Sustaining APIs Has Become Costly

Most individuals will walk in the door and want to emphasize that their organization is unique, has their own way of approaching things, and will need the most custom approach available, when in reality 80% of what is happening is the same struggles that other enterprises face, they just haven’t been exposed to it.
