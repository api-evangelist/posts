On November 20, 2000, eBay launched the eBay Application Program Interface (API) and introduced the eBay Developers Program. Initially, the eBay API was made available exclusively to a select group of licensed eBay partners and developers. As eBay stated:

"Our new API has tremendous potential to revolutionize the way people do business on eBay and increase the amount of business transacted on the site. By openly providing the tools that developers need to create applications based on eBay technology, we believe eBay will eventually be tightly woven into many existing sites as well as future e-commerce ventures."

The launch of the eBay API was a strategic response to the increasing number of applications that were leveraging its platform, both legitimately and illegitimately. The API was designed to standardize integration methods and simplify the process for partners and developers to create tools and businesses within the eBay ecosystem.

eBay is widely regarded as a pioneer in the modern era of web-based APIs and web services, setting a foundation for the development of interconnected online platforms and marketplaces.
