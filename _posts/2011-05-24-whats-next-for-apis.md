kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/gluecon.jpg)I'm preparing for another talk tomorrow at the [Glue conference](http://gluecon.com/2011/ "Glue Conference") in Colorado. Glue is a conference that assists architects, developers, administrators and integrators in solving problems around web application integration.

Glue is about all of bits and pieces, APIs and meta-data, standards and connectors that will help us to glue together the varying applications of the new platform.

I'm on a panel at Glue called, [Whats Next for APIs](http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16 "Whats Next for APIs")?. I'm stoked to be invited along with some major players in the API space:

*   [Sam Ramji](http://twitter.com/#!/sramji "Sam Ramjii"), [Apigee](http://www.apigee.com "Apigee")
*   [Delyn Simons](http://twitter.com/#!/delynator "Delyn Simons"), [Mashery](http://www.mashery.com "Mashery")
*   [Scott Monson](http://twitter.com/#!/skmonson "Scott Monson"), [Alcatel-Lucent](http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/ "Alcatel-Lucent")

The session is moderated by [Adam DuVander](http://twitter.com/#!/adamd "Adam DuVander") of [ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com "ProgrammableWeb").

The areas I'm focusing on covering are:

*   Technology & Tools
*   Embeddable
*   Developers
*   Monetization
*   Industries & Common Areas
*   Legal

I'm excited to discuss whats next with leaders in the API industry.

I hope you can make it out to Glue for our session at 2:00 to 3:00 PM on Wednesday. It should be an interesting look into the future, regarding APIs.
