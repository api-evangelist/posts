I’m stoked to announce that [Steve Klabnik](http://www.steveklabnik.com/ "Steve Klabnik") will be speaking at the [API Strategy & Practice conference](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php "API Strategy & Practice"), November 1st & 2nd in New York City. I just added him to the homepage and [speaker line-up](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php "API Speakers").

Steve is a highly respected Ruby developer, software craftsman, and an aspiring digital humanities scholar. He spends most of his time contributing to Open Source projects, and maintains both [Hackety Hack](http://hackety.com/ "Hackety Hack") and [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/ "Shoes"), while also teaching and helping develop curriculum for [Jumpstart Lab](http://www.jumpstartlab.com/ "JumpStart Labs").

Steve has has written book on [Designing Hypermedia APIs](http://designinghypermediaapis.com/ "Designing Hypermedia APIs"). Well it’s better than a book. I’d call it a "living digital book". One where you can constantly come back and get fresh content and interact with the books community and author. Much better than the old-school programming book, which you buy once and it sits on your shelf.

What intrigues me about Steve, is that his perspective is very technical, but in his own words, “_I've found a place between the sciences and the humanities._” Which is a point of view we need to give a platform to, and everyone in Silicon Valley needs to listen.

Steve is exactly the fresh perspective we want to get at the [API Strategy & Practice conference](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php "API Strategy & Practice"). I hope you can join us for the two day event in November and be there in person for Steve’s talk.
