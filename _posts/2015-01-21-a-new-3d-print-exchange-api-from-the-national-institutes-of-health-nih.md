There is an very interesting new 3D Print Exchange API from the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](http://www.nih.gov/). The NIH 3D Print Exchange is designed for publishing "biomedically-relevant" 3D models, that anyone can download and use as blueprint for printing on a their 3D printer.

I've been [tracking on 3D printing APIs since 2011](http://3d-printing.apievangelist.com/companies.html), when I started profiling [how APIs were being used by printing, and 3D printing providers](http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/19/api-driven-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/). It is interesting to see an industry focused 3D printing API emerge, which I feel is a sign the space is maturing, and will continuing to evolve in 2015.

Another thing to note in this story, is simplistic approach the NIH took in deploying their API. The 3D Print Exchange API has all the essential building blocks to help you understand what the API does, on-board with the API (another story), and get the support you need throughout integration via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nih3dprint),Â [Github](https://github.com/niaid/3dpx_api), and [email](mailto: 3dprint@nih.gov).

The [3D Print Exchange API](http://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/) has all the fingerprints of [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) on it, demonstrating that APIs in the federal government will continue to pick up momentum with the assistance of 18F of the Presidential Innovation Fellowship (PIF) program out of the White House and GSA.
