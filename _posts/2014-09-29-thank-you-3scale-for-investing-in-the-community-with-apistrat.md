We just wrapped up the [4th edition of @APIStrat in Chicago](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php) last week, and once again I’m very happy with the way things went, as 400+ folks gathered to discuss APIs. The event had the right tone, and I got the usual flood of comments from attendees, speakers, and sponsors about what a great experience the event was.

I would love to take credit, but all of the responsibility goes to [3Scale](http://bit.ly/13esk6Q) for making it happen. 3Scale takes all the risk, and their rockstar team makes the event a reality—I just help get folks to the conference, contribute ideas to the schedule, present, and MC as much of the event as I possibly can.

@APIStrat has been helping move forward the conversation in the API space for two years now, starting with [New York](http://apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/) and [San Francisco](http://apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/) in 2013, and now [Amsterdam](http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/) and [Chicago](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php) in 2014, all made possible because of 3Scale's investment.

The number one priority for 3Scale, when it comes to @APIStrat, is to move the conversation forward, while investing in the API community. This is why the event is a success, setting the tone for the conversation amongst sponsors, speakers, and attendees. I’m thankful for being able to to take part in @APIStrat, and look forward to digesting all of the [videos from Chicago, which are already on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat).

We’ve already announced that the next @APIStrat will be in Berlin, spring 2015, and we are [accepting input on where it should for the fall of 2015](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/2014/09/24/as-apistrat-chicago-kicks-off-apistrat-europe-and-us-for-2015-are-in-the-works--we-want-your-input/). Let me know if there are any topics you’d like to see discussed at @APIStrat 2015, and we'll see about getting your ideas into the lineup.
