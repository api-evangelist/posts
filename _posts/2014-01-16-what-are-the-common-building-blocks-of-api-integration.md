I started API Evangelist in 2010 to help business leaders better understand not just the technical, but specifically the business of APIs, helping them be successful in their own API efforts. As part of these efforts I track on what I consider the [building blocks of API management](http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html). In 2014 I'm also researching what the building blocks are in other areas of the API world, including API [design](http://design.apievangelist.com "API Design"), [deployment](http://deployment.apievangelist.com/ "API deployment"), [discovery](http://discovery.apievangelist.com/) and [integration](http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html "API integration").

After taking a quick glance at the fast growing world of API integration tools and services, I've found the following building blocks emerging:

**Pain Point Monitoring**

![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-documentation.png)

**Documentation Monitoring** - Keeping track of changes to an APIs documentation, alerting you to potential changes in valuable developer API documentation for single or many APIs

![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-dollar-sign.jpg)

**Pricing Monitoring** - Notifications when an API platform's pricing changes, which might trigger switching services or at least staying in tune with the landscape of what is being offered

![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-terms-conditions.png)

**Terms of Use Monitoring** - Updates when a company changes the terms of service for a particular platform and providing historical versions for comparison

What else are you seeing? Which tools and services do you depend on when you are integrating one or many APIs into your applications? What tools and services would you like to see?

I'm [looking at the world of API design](http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/ "API Design") right now, but once I'm done with that research, I will be diving into API integration again, trying to better understand the key players, tools, services and the building blocks they use to get things done.
