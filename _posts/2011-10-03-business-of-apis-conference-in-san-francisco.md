That is a whole lot of API experience. I went to BAPI last year, and the talks were great and I connected with a bunch of other API experts, during the half-day event.

BAPI is from 1:00 – 5:30 at the [Julia Morgan Ballroom](http://www.juliamorganballroom.com/ "Julia Morgan Ballroom") in San Francisco. The [San Francisco BAPI](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1825463009?ref=ebtn "San Francisco BAPI") is the first of three events, with a [New York event October 19th](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025693905?ref=ebtn "New York event October 19th") and a [London event October 25th](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025746061?ref=ebtn "London event October 25th").

Registration is still open for all three events. I highly recommend getting to at least one of them if you can.
