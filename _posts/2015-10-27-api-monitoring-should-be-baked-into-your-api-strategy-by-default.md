[As I've written several posts on the recent Amazon API Gateway release](http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/11/some-potentially-very-powerful-api-orchestration-with-the-amazon-api-gateway/), one of the side things I noted about the API solution from AWS, was that API monitoring is baked in by default. As stated on the [AWS API Gateway page](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/):

_After your API is deployed, Amazon API Gateway provides you with a dashboard to visually monitor calls to your services using Amazon CloudWatch, so you see performance metrics and information on API calls, data latency, and error rates._

This may seem like common sense to many people who have been in the API space for a while now, but for many API designers, architects, developers, and business folk who are just getting going, API monitoring may not be default for all implementations.

To me, AWS baking in [API monitoring](http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/) by default, demonstrates that the world of API monitoring has matured, marking an important milestone that all API providers should pay attention to. I've been watching this space grow over the last couple years, and similar to the API management space, the AWS release reflects the overall health of the API sector.

If you are operating any API In 2015, monitoring should be standard operating procedure, alongside your API documentation.
