It has been a while since I looked at the 250K view of what is going on with APIs across federal government agencies in the United States. Since working for the Obama administration in 2013 I am perpetually on a quest to map out what is happening across federal agencies, helping drive the conversation forward. I belieive APIs can make the most impact when our federal government helps lead the way, and I am looking to help push things forward in the following ways.

*   **Keep mapping out the Federal Government API Landscape** - I am determined to produce a map of the APIs that exist across federal agencies and keep the list alive and active.
*   **Establish Public API Workspaces for Federal Agencies -** I am looking to establish public API workspaces for agencies who are implementing APIs--helping do some work from the outside-in.
*   **Refresh My Memory of What is Happening -** I thrive on knowing what is going on across federal agencies, and doing these reviews pushes me to refresh my awarenss of APIs at this level.
*   **Fire Up new Conversations -** These sotries always rise up in the SEO game and bring in new conversations with folks who are doing interesting things with APIs in government.

I always learn a lot looking through the different government agencies. I learn even more wading through the different datasets, databases, and various incarnations of APIs. There is way too much work here than one person can handle, and much of what I come across labeled as an API really isn't an API, but could be with a little work. While doing these roundups I always reach a point where I feel like I am not doing enough, but ultimately I have to strike a balance between being comprehensive and just scratching the surface. Providing just enough information to allow me to plant seeds that might grow into new conversations down the road, while not spend all of my days sifting through the backwaters of federal government websites. This is my latest attempt to map out what is happenign with APIs across federal agencies in 2020, with some learnings and ongoing thought about what else can be done down below.
