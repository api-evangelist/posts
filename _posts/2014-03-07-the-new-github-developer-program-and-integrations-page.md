Github just announced [a new developer program](https://github.com/blog/1790-announcing-the-github-developer-program), which will allow [Github API](http://developer.github.com/v3/) developers to receive notifications about upcoming changes to the API, and get early access on some feature releases.

As part of the new developer program, you can also submit your work for inclusion on their [integrations page](https://github.com/integrations), which is essentially a showcase of the best Github integrations out there.

A beta program or refined developer group within your API ecosystem makes sense. Having an API access tier where the more engaged developers can step up, and play a closer role in the API roadmap, can bring some serious value to the table.

I’ve blogged about the benefits of [multiple levels of API access](http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/) for a couple years now, and Github’s approach shows their API ecosystem is maturing, and they are further formalizing the incubation of ideas, applications and partnerships within the Github API ecosystem.
