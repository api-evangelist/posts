[While we officially launched](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php) [API Strategy & Practice, San Francisco edition](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php) back in May, we've been pretty quiet during the summer months. Well, now summer is coming to a close, and we are now less than 60 days away from the API community conversation that is #APIStrat.

To start ramping things up, I'm going to start showcasing the [amazing line-up of speakers](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/speakers.php) we have for the event, and giving the [kick-ass sponsors](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/sponsors.php "kick-ass sponsors") who have stepped up to support the event, the "love" they deserve.

Early bird pricing has ended, but you have less than a month to get in on the mid range pricing. Don't miss out like so many did in February when #APIStrat New York City sold out--[buy your tickets](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/register.php) now.

Even with large number of speakers we have lined up, we still have some slots left open, and will be making some announcements of other big names to the lineup-so stay tuned.

I will be exploring the wide range of topics and tracks we have planned here on API Evangelist as well as the [#APIStrat blog](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/blog.php "APIStrat Blog"), so subscribe to our RSS feeds and tune in on Twitter for more details.
