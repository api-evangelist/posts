kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/gluecon.jpg)I'm preparing for a talk tomorrow at the [Glue conference](http://gluecon.com/2011/ "Glue Conference") in Colorado. Glue is a conference that assists architects, developers, administrators and integrators in solving problems around web application integration.

Glue is about all of bits and pieces, APIs and meta-data, standards and connectors that will help us to glue together the varying applications of the new platform.

I'm joining [Justin Tormey](http://twitter.com/#!/justintormey "Justin Tormey"), Director, Customer Evangelism - Open API Platform at Alcatel-Lucent to present a session called [Finishing School for Potential API Providers](http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16 "Finishing School for Potential API Providers").

The outline for our session is:

*   If you build it... they won't come
*   Common Building Blocks
*   Innovative Building Blocks
*   Developer ? Developer
*   Monetization
*   Customers ? Customers
*   Make it concrete.
*   Evangelism

We hope you can make it out to Glue for our session at 1:30-2:00 PM on Wednesday. It should be a realistic perspective about whats needed for anyone looking to deploy an API.
