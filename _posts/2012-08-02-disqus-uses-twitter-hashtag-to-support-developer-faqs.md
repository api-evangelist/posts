I’m always on the lookout for extremely simple ways API Evangelists can support their developers without rolling out complex tools or platforms. The latest approach comes from the [Disqus API](http://disqus.com/api/docs/ "Disqus API"), and how they are using Twitter to answer developer questions.

> Tweet with the hashtag [#**DisqusFAQ**](https://twitter.com/search/%23DisqusFAQ) to get your frequently asked questions answered by [@**disqus**](https://twitter.com/disqus)!

Using a #hashtag is a great way to allow developers to ask questions without learning some new system or complex process. They can simply Tweet out their question in real-time, in a format they are hopefully already familiar with.

As an API owner, you can quickly help solve a developers problem, allowing them to get back to developing. Because of the Twitter 140 character format it will help keep their questions brief. Then using the Twitter REST API, you can easily pull, filter and integrate FAQs for your API into your master FAQ list.

Thanks Disqus for keeping developer support so simple.
