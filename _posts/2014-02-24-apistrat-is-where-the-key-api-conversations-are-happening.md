I’m working with Phil Legetter ([@leggetter](https://twitter.com/leggetter)) to put together a panel at API Strategy & Practice in Amsterdam on APIs and realtime, and as I’m working to bring together the leaders from the space together, I can’t help but think of past APIStrat panels. At APIStrat we are looking to pull together the leaders from different business sectors and have a conversation on where we are, and where things are going with trends like API aggregation, automation, design, BaaS and realtime.

At [APIStrat, NYC 203 we brought together the leaders from the backend as a service (BaaS) space,](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service) including Ilya Sukhar ([@ilyasu](https://twitter.com/ilyasu)) of [Parse](http://www.parse.com/), Morgan Bickle ([@morganbickle](https://twitter.com/morganbickle)) of [Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com/), Marc Weil ([@marcweil](https://twitter.com/marcweil)) of [Cloudmine](https://cloudmine.me/), Miko Matasumura ([@mikojava](https://twitter.com/mikojava)) of [Kii](http://kii.com/), Ty Amell ([@tyamell](https://twitter.com/tyamell)) of [StackMob](https://www.stackmob.com/) James Tamplin ([@jamestamplin](https://twitter.com/jamestamplin)) of [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), resulting in a pretty interesting discuss about what is BaaS, and the future of the fast growing trend in using APIs for mobile development.

Fast-forward to March of 2014, Parse has been acquired by Facebook, Stackmob acquired by Paypal and shut-down just last week, and the speed at which the tech sector moves is really evident. I started tracking on BaaS in 2011, and just 3 years later the space has evolved fast—making conversations like the APIStrat BaaS panel critical in helping shape the industry.

As APIs + realtime technologies gain in popularity amongst startups and leading tech companies, its time to get together and have a conversation with leading tech companies in the realtime space like [Pusher](http://pusher.com/), [Pubnub](http://www.pubnub.com/), [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), and [Fanout.io](https://fanout.io/) to name a few. Much like BaaS, the important conversations around key trends in API like realtime, will be occurring at APIStrat.

These conversations are why the [3Scale](http://bit.ly/13esk6Q) team and API Evangelist put on #APIStrat, and look forward to you being part of these important discussions. Make sure you are [registered for API Strategy & Practice in Amsterdam, March 26-28th](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php).
