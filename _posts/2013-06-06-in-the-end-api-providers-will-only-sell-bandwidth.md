I got an email from [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/ "IFTTT") last night, simply stating: 

_As of today, IFTTT has stopped supporting the Posterous Channel. The Channel has been removed, along with any Recipes that made use of Posterous Triggers or Actions._ 

_If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at support@ifttt.com. Thanks for your continued support._ 

_—The IFTTT Team_ 

This announcement, follows a similar one a couple weeks ago, where [IFTT also ceased support for channels that pull your data from Twitter](http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/09/21/why-ifttt-forced-remove-twitter-triggers-red-alert-developers/).  

Since Posterous is owned by Twitter, it's easy to see the parallels in the decision by IFTTT.
