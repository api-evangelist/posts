I was profiling the [video sharing API Dailymotion](https://developer.dailymotion.com) the other day, going through their developer area and profiling their API operations. One of the things I [do as part of the profiling of any company](http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/), is checkout how they execute their support.

[Dailymotion employs two very common building blocks for their platform support](https://developer.dailymotion.com/support), including an API specific Twitter handle, and good ol fashion emailâ€”both pretty proven approaches. However Dailymotion also employs a third aspect to thier API support, by recommending you head over to Stack Overflow for some community support.

Using [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) in this way is not that original, I see numerous API providers doing this, the part I found interesting was their reference to getting Dailymotion API support via Stack Overflow as, "ask the stack!" I like that, I think it reflects what Stack Overflow is to the API developer community, and was an elegant way to send API developers off your site, to get the support they need.
