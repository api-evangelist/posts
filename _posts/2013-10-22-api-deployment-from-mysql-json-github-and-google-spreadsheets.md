I'm doing a lot more API deployments from dead simple data sources since I started working in the federal government. As part of these efforts I'm working to put together a simple toolkit that newbies to the API world can use to rapidly deploy APIs as well.

Currently I have four separate deployment blueprints done:

*   [MySQL to API](http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/21/deploy-api-mysql-to-api)
*   [Local JSON to API](http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/21/deploy-api-json-to-api)
*   [Github JSON to API](http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-github-json-to-api)
*   [Google Spreadsheet to API](http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api)

All of these samples are in PHP and uses the Slim PHP REST framework. They are meant to be working examples that you can use to seed your own API deployment.

I'm also including these in my government API workshop at #APIStrat this week, hoping to get other people equipped with the necessary skills and tools they need to get APIs in the wild.

You can find the entire [working repository](https://github.com/kinlane/api-deploy-toolkit), including Slim framework at Github.
