Since 2010 I have had a page on this site dedicated to "API Management". In 2013 the API universe expanded, and I've broken my work in this area into three separate, open source API research projects.

*   [**Design**](http://design.apievangelist.com)
*   [**Deployment**](http://deployment.apievangelist.com)
*   [**Management**](http://management.apievangelist.com)

I'm grouping these projects under a single umbrella, I'm now calling "[providing APIs](http://apievangelist.com/provide/ "providing APIs")". If you are a company or organization looking to provide API driven resources to partners, the public or even use them for internal operations, this section is for you.

I will be adding several other API research areas in the near future, including:

*   Monetization
*   Evangelism
*   Security
*   Embeddable

For each of the projects you will find building blocks, companies, tools, news and analysis. All projects stick to my new [Hacker Storytelling](http://hackerstorytelling.com "Hacker Storytelling") format, making sure my research is open, distributable and machine readable.
