I was just reading a post via [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/ "BuzzFeed"), that [Twitter was going to remove third-party image services from its apps](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/twitter-is-removing-third-party-image-services-fro "Twitter was going to remove third-party image services from its apps"). _“According to a person who was briefed on the company's plans”_, the changes will be coming in the next updates to the Twitter client(s).

"They're trying to control those eyeballs on their apps, they're an ad-based company, they make money that way,” says Twitpic founder Noah Everett, according to [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/ "BuzzFeed").

One thing is clear. Twitter is serious in its effort to take control over its ecosystem.  It has a plan, and it's systematically rolling it out, taking control over each area it needs to maximize "promoted" revenue.
