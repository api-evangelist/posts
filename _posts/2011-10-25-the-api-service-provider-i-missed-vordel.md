I have done a lot of research lately on the [API service provider](/serviceproviders/ "API Service Provider") landscape. My goal is to understand who provides API delivery and management services, what they offer and help API owners understand the differences.

I wrote a [roundup of 11 of the API service providers on ProgrammableWeb](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/ "roundup of 11 of the API service providers") last week. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of all the providers, but of course a new one came out of the woodwork.

It wasn't a new API service provider like [Mashape](/serviceproviders/mashape.php) or [Apiary.io](/2011/10/07/easy-api-development-with-apiary-io/), it is a veteran player in the space, [Vordel](http://www.vordel.com/ "Vordel"). Vordel has been around for almost 10 years and I would consider them part of the old guard of service oriented architecture (SOA) and web services providers, that existed before web APIs were cool.

Vordel provides a range of products we recognize with enterprise API deployments including [API Gateways](http://www.vordel.com/solutions/api_gateway2.html "API Gateways"), [XML firewalls](http://www.vordel.com/solutions/xml_firewall.html "XML Firewalls") and [accelerators](http://www.vordel.com/solutions/xml_accelerator.html "XML accelerators"). Vordel specializes in the legacy system connectors that are needed to bring existing enterprise systems into the new web API game.

The Vordel API Gateway compares to what I've seen from [Layer7](http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/layer-7-technologies-launches-new-api-portal/ "Layer7") and [SOA Software](/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/ "SOA Software"), with the following key features:

*   Protocol translation for REST and SOAP
*   Versioning and lifecycle management
*   Caching of frequently used calls
*   Monitor, log and audit usage
*   Secure API from threats
*   Service level agreements (SLA)

Vordel has an impressive client list including the FBI, Coast Guard and Dunn & Bradstreet, and delivers some progressive integrations, like a deployment of their API gateway for [Blackhawk Network](http://www.blackhawknetwork.com/ "Blackhawk Network"), which extends REST services to their business partners like iTunes and Facebook.

I see all the hardened enterprise services I've seen with existing providers, I think why they may have missed my radar is they lack the open API building blocks like developer portals, app showcases, forums and the self-service partner systems I tend to track on.

Vordel is new to me, it will take some more time to get to know their products and team like I have with existing API management service providers. As I learn more about Vordel I will share more information about the company, the services they offer, and what makes them stand out from existing landscape of [API service providers](/serviceproviders/ "API Service Providers").
