I like a good API shirt.  If you've ever seen me in person you've seen my API Evangelist shirt(s).  At least you guys hope its multiple shirts, otherwise...ewwwee!

I recently started a new design - my [Che P.I. t-shirt.](/2012/12/13/get-my-new-che-p.i.-shirts/)  

There is an OG API t-shirt that recirculated this week for me--the [You Can't Spell Capitalism Without API](http://schwag.140proof.com/product/capitalism-t-shirt).  This is an awesome shirt from the [social advertising platform, 140 Proof](http://www.140proof.com/).  

140 Proof launched the shirt at the Twitter Chirp Conference, and I think it is a classic, that should never go away.

I'm ordering one for christmas!
