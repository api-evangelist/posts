I am working on a variety of stories, guides, and marketing materials for Postman around everything that has led up to this moment. I'm going to keep adding to this list, and flesing out the details of how each of these points in time have helped get us here. 

If you have any additions feel free to lobby me via Twitter or email, and I'll consider adding. Share the moments in time, the technology, and how it helped set the tone for what we are all doing in 2019, and I might add it to the list, baking into the Postman storytelling throughout 2020.
