I thought [the microservices platform Nanoscale.io](http://www.nanoscale.io/) have an interesting argument for why you would upgrade to a paid plan. [On their pricing page](http://www.nanoscale.io/pricing/), after they break down each of the pricing plans they provide you with four reasons of why you would want to upgrade from their free tier.

*   **More powerful APIs -** Your nanoscale.io hosted microservices can run longer and perform more complex operations, or access slower source systems, without timing out.
*   **Get premium support -** Having a problem with nanoscale.io? Think you may have found a bug? Submit your inquiry and get a guaranteed response from our technical team.
*   **Influence product roadmap -** We are open to new feature consideration, and give preference to paid accounts to influence which ones get built sooner.
*   **Deploy anywhere -** Upgrade your downloadable nanoscale.io server with a production license to deploy your microservices on any infrastructure you choose.

More power and support seems like no-brainers. Being able to influence the roadmap is a compelling reason and something I would pay money for! ;-) The deploy anywhere I think is a sign of the future, not just for how you will buy services for your API, this is how you will deploy your APIs for your consumers. In cloud. On-premise. On-device. You can consume our API anywhere you want--if you pay for it!

[I have been aggregating the plans and pricing of API providers, and service providers for a while now](http://plans.apievangelist.com/). People are getting better at providing a decent breakdown of their API plans, but they aren't always that good at articulating the reasons why you would go from free to a paid plan. I think this is an area of stress, and concern for many API providers, and an area they could use more examples to follow from out in the wild.
