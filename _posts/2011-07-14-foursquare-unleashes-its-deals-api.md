kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/foursquare_logo.png)[Foursquare launched a new Merchant API](http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/07/13/more-powerful-tools-for-businesses-introducing-our-merchant-api/ "Foursquare launched a new Merchant API") that will allow developers and merchants to create specials using any technology.

The new Merchant API comes right after their [announcement of a national partnership with American Express](http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/06/23/american-express-specials-now-for-everyone-nationwide/ "announcements of national partnership with American Express"), and the new API will make it even easier for other merchant partners to create deals using foursquare.

It looks like foursquare is depending on its 10,000-strong developer community to take on Facebook and Groupon in the deal-making space.
