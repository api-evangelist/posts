[I wrote about the need for service level agreements dedicated to researchers who are depending on APIs a couple weeks ago](http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/service-level-agreements-for-researchers-who-depend-on-apis/), and while I was doing [my work profiling of AWS](http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/), I came across their approach to supporting research. [Amazon has a dedicated program research and technical computing on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/), where they:

_"helps researchers process complex workloads by providing the cost-effective, scalable and secure compute, storage and database capabilities needed to accelerate time-to-science. With AWS, scientists can quickly analyze massive data pipelines, store petabytes of data and share their results with collaborators around the world, focusing on science not servers."_

Amazon has three distinct ways in which they are helping researchers, as well as the industries and people they impact:

*   **[AWS Research Cloud Program](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/research-cloud-program/)** - The AWS Research Cloud Program helps you focus on science, not servers
