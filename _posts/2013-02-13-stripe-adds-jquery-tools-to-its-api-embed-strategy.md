The payment API provider Stripe [released a jQuery payment tool](https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment), a general purpose library for building credit card forms, validating input, and formatting numbers. The library was developed to support [Checkout](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-checkout), Stripe's embeddable checkout widget.

Simple, but extremely useful libraries like this can go a long way to introduce developers to your APIs and put valuable tools into their toolbox, that will help them be successful. Â Something that can go a long way in establishing a loyalty between you and your developer community.

You can find a [live demo](http://stripe.github.com/jquery.payment/example/) of the library, as well as the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment).
