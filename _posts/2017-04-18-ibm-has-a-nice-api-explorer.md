[IBM has a pretty cool explorer format for their API catalog](https://developer.ibm.com/api/list), allowing you to searchÂ and browse the IBM API catalog by category, and even broken down preview, beta, and live APIs. It looks like there are about 60+ APIs in the catalog so far, with a mix of uses.

Each API has the essential building blocks like getting started, documentation, pricing, and other resources. I don't see any machine readable index like APIs.json or OpenAPI but will keep an eye out. If I have the time I will generate an index for the project after I'm done with some of the other leading cloud and machine learning platforms like [AWS](http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/) and [Google](http://google.stack.network/).
