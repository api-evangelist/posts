It is 30 days until the [API Strategy & Practice conference in New York City](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/), February 21st and 22nd, and the event is now sold out!

The event will be a 275 person conference focused on discussing the API industry.

Since the event was postponed after Hurricane Sandy, the demand to get in and speak was overwhelming and conference tickets didn’t last long either.

We were able to keep almost all the [original session lineup](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php) while make a couple changes and squeezing in a couple new speakers, where possible.

I am really pleased with how the event has come together. We have an amazing lineup and from looking at the attendee list, it looks like it will be a diverse groups of folks in attendance, discussing APIs.

I look forward to seeing you all in New York!
