The end of the year is a great time to reflect--looking back at the year with a desire to quantify and understand ourselves.

With our increasingly digital (social, cloud, mobile, APIs) lives, there are more opportunities than ever to ask our digital self very specific questions, and with the power the API get an answer back.

Over the holidayz, I spent some time asking some questions I wanted to know about my world in 2012--things that were important to me, and help me feel healthy, happy, accomplished and ultimately successful. (aka. [Optimize for Happiness](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html))

I broke these questions up into interest areas, then using APIs set out to find the services I use, or could use, that would help me answer these questions.

This is all a work in progress.  I wanted a list that could evolve, but I could use as a framework for actually answering some of these questions--either annually or real-time if possible, using APIs.

To facilitate this process, I've [published as project on Github](http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/ "Personal Data Questions").  I will be publishing all the questions I ask, and their solutions.  

So far, I've been able to use [Singly](http://singly.com) and answer a number of critical questions about 2012 using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Google--via the [Singly API](http://singly.com).

If you have questions you'd like asked, you can visit my [personal data questions project](http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/) and comment via Disqus or if you want, you can [fork and contribute](https://github.com/kinlane/personal-data-questions) your own questions and API driven solutions.
