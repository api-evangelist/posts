After [recovering from an amazing week in Berlin for APIDaysBerlin / APIStrat Europe 2015](http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/27/thank-you-berlin-for-helping-make-apidaysberlin--apistrat-europe-so-amazing/), and catching up on some work, which [included a 20 hour push to get the last weeks API.Report completed](http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/28/weekly-apireport-for-april-27th-2015/), I am now preparing for [API Days Mediterranea, May 6th & 7th in Barcelona, Spain](http://mediterranea.apidays.io/). The event is billed as "The Independent Conference on APIs, NLP, and Language Technology", and brings together may of the leading API minds, but also the cross-over with APIs and language technology--something you won't see anywhere else.

While the main event is next Wednesday and Thursday, things kick off the night before, on Tuesday, May 5th with some pre-conference workshops and partying at 3Scales office:

*   17:30 - Practical 3scale API Management Crash Course at 3scale's office ([register](http://www.meetup.com/API-Meetup-Barcelona/events/221808677/))
*   19:00 - API Meetup Barcelona: Marketing APIs: Do's and Dont's and APIdays warm-up party at 3scale's office ([register](http://www.meetup.com/API-Meetup-Barcelona/events/221808517/))

Then starting Wednesday, the main event kicks off with many of the usual suspects, who don't just lead in the API industry, but also work very hard traveling the world evangelizing API best practices:

*   Mike Amundsen ([@mamund](https://twitter.com/mamund)), [CA Technologies](http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx) - From Stacia to Hyperion and Back Again: A Hypermedia Hero's Tale
*   Steve Klabnik ([@steveklabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik)), Hypermedia Evangelist - JSON API: your anti-bikeshedding weapon
*   Bruno Pedro ([@bpedro](https://twitter.com/bpedro)), [Redbooth](https://redbooth.com/) & [API Changelog](https://www.apichangelog.com/) - How to Automate API Discovery
*   Andy Thurai ([@andythurai](https://twitter.com/andythurai)), [IBM](http://ibm.com) - Machine Learning with IBM Watson and Alchemy API
*   Tyler Singletary ([@harmophone](https://twitter.com/harmophone)), [Klout](https://klout.com/home) - Topics as an Engine For Insights
*   Tony Blank ([@thetonyblank](https://twitter.com/thetonyblank)), [Context.io](http://Context.io) - The True Value Of Email Data
*   Manfred Bortenschlager ([@manfredbo](https://twitter.com/manfredbo)), [3scale](http://3scale.net) - What does it take to design and run a successful API program?

It doesn't stop there. What really makes me happy about APIDays, is the increasing number of local, and regional API talent the event attracts. I see a number of other talented API prfoessional, doing some very interesting talks, ranging from the business of APIs to hypermedia. This is the most important aspect of APIDays in my opinion, is that it doesn't just import API talent from around the world, it also cultivates and grows local and regional API voices.

I will also be speaking, closing up the two day event, with a talk on what I'm calling "A Community Driven API Lifecycle", where I'll showcase some of the work I'm doing around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, driven by Swagger, Docker, and brought together using APIs.json. This is the first in a series of talks I'll be doing on this subject, concluding with Gluecon in Colorado, later this month.

[If you aren't registered, visit the site and get signed up before all the tickets are gone, the space is limited, and I know they have already sold most of the tickets](http://mediterranea.apidays.io/). I look forward to hanging out with some of my old friends in the space, as well as making some new ones, and hearing their stories of API design, deployment, management, discovery, and integration, in one of the my favorite cities--Barcelona.
