[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/stack-overflow/stackoverflow-logo-250.png)](http://stackoverflow.com/)[StackApps](http://stackapps.com) is an API for the family of Q&A websites using the Stack Exchange engine including [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/) and [Super User](http://superuser.com/).

StackApps provides a RESTFul API using a basic application key authentication. The API provides access to Stack Apps user data as well as questions, answers and comments.

No code samples or language packs are provided, they provide a link to the [World's Worst Stack Overflow Clone](http://stackapps.com/questions/3/sample-application-worlds-worst-stackoverflow-clone) which is a sample application written in C# and a hello world URL example.
