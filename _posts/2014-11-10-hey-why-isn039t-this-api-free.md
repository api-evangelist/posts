It always makes me happy to see a pricing page, front and center when I visit an API, but I found an added bonus over at the email API, Inbox. At the bottom of their pricing page, they have a pretty simple question: _**Hey, why isn't this free?**_

I like their style. I just don't understand the smoke & mirrors when it comes to pricing in the API space, and fully support API providers who offer no B.S. pricing for their API resources.

It is little things like this that keep me trolling through the developer areas, and back alleys of the API space each day.
