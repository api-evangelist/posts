[Time Tracking API platform Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/ "Time Tracking Platform Harvest") has embraced Github as part of their API ecosystem. I'm always on the hunt for examples of API providers using Github, so I figured I'd showcase Harvest's creative use of the social coding platform.

Starting with their documentation, the Harvest team has moved the [API documentation to a Github repository](https://github.com/harvesthq/api), allowing developers to "watch" the API, get updates when changes are made, asks questions or even contribute to the API docs by submitting a pull request.

Harvest is also using the wiki portion of their Github repo for a developer application gallery they are calling [Community Creations and Hacks](https://github.com/harvesthq/api/wiki/Community-Creations-&-Hacks), where they showcase innovative uses of the Harvest API--currently displaying 20 integrations by Harvest users.

I'm currently tracking on [11 separate uses of Github for API management](http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/ "11 separate uses of Github for API management"), and always on the hunt for new ways to use Github to support API ecosystems. Nice move Harvest!
