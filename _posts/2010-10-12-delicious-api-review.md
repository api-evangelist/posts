[Delicious](http://www.delicious.com) is a social bookmarking web service for storing, sharing, and discovering Web bookmarks.

[Delicious has a RESTful API](http://www.delicious.com/help/api), with a HTTP-Auth authentication. Using the API, you can read and write Delicious bookmarks and tags. Delicious provides some PHP Curl scripts for connecting, but no other language kits.
