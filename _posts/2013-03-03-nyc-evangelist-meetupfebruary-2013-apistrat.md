During [API Strategy & Practice in New York City](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/), there was an awesome gathering of developer evangelists at the [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard) offices, for the [NYC Evangelist Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nycevangelists/events/104141492/).

I got the chance to hang out with several evangelist I know online, but have never met in person.  We drank beers, ate pizza and talked about all things evangelist, evangelism, advocacy and hopefully some normal shit too. 

Thanks for having me over everyone!  Have you ever seen so many evangelists in one room?
