We sat down with [Vincent Biret, Microsoft Graph SDKs Principal Software Developer at Microsoft](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/store/2025-01-19-vincent-biret-microsoft/) to talk about all things integration. We are very interested in the intersection of APIs, specifications, and integrations where Vincent operates. Vincent shared his view of the important role that OpenAPI plays in taming the Microsoft Graph API landscape, but specifically how it gets applied as part of producer or consumer driven SDK generation using Kiota. Vincent shared all kinds of experience and wisdom at this intersection, but he also shared a pragmatic view of the role APIs, specs, and integrations play when it comes to training LLMs, but also feeding agents deployed on top of those LLMs with the real-time resources and capabilities they will need.

What really stood out in this conversation for us was the focus on the API consumer when it comes to SDK generation. The majority of discussion around SDK generation is targeting API producers, but reversing the polarity and applying to our existing research around APIs, OpenAPI, collections, documentation, explorers, playgrounds, SDKs, and integrations, makes for very interesting stories to tell. Vincents's AI integration narrative was impressively coherent and logical and reflects our view that AI is just the next in the application chain along with desktop, web, mobile, device, and network applications. We will dive into some stories around the SDK landscape from the consumer view, and then take another listen to this conversation to consider some of the specification, parsing, and other relevant bits from our conversation with Vincent.
