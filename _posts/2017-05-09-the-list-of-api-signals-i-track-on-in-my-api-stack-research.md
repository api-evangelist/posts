I keep an eye on several thousand companies as part of my research into the API space and publish over a thousand of these profiles in [my API Stack project](http://theapistack.com). Across the over 1,100 companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies I'm regularly running into [a growing number of signals that tune me into what is going on with each API provider](http://theapistack.com/channel-types/), or service provider. 

Here are the almost 100 types of signals I am tuning into as I keep an eye on the world of APIs, each contributing to my unique awareness of what is going on with everything API.

There are hundreds of other building blocks I track on as part of API operations, but this list represents the most common, that often have dedicated URLs available for exploring, and have the most significant impact on API integrations. You'll notice there is an x- representation for each one, which I use as part of [APIs.json indexes](http://apisjson.org) for all the APIs I track on. Some of these signal types are machine readable like OpenAPIs or a Blog RSS, with others machine readable because there is another API behind, like Twitter or Github, but most of them are just static pages, where a human (me) can visit and stay in tune with signals.

I have two primary objectives with this work: 1) identify the important signals, that impact integration, and will keep me and my readers in tune with what is going on, and 2) identify the common channels, and help move the more important ones to be machine-readable, allowing us to scale the monitoring of important signals like [pricing](http://plans.apievangelist.com) and terms of service. [My API Stack research provides me wit a nice listing of APIs](http://theapistack.com/), as well as more individualized stacks like [Microsoft](http://microsoft.stack.network/), [Google](http://google.stack.network/), [Microsoft](http://microsoft.stack.network/), and [Facebook](http://facebook.stack.network/), or even industry stacks like [SMS](http://sms.stack.network/), [Email](http://email.stack.network/), and [News](http://news.stack.network/). It also provides me with a wealth of signals we can tune into better understand the scope and health of the API sector, and any individual business vertical that is being touched by APIs.
