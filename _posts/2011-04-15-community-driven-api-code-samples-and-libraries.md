[Sample code libraries](http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125 "Sample Code Libraries") are an essential part of an API ecosystem. They give developers a head start when integrating their applications with an API.

I've explored the concept of [letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries](http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/01/use-your-community-to-build-api-code-libraries/ "letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries"). Doing this may create a more engaged community and give developers a sense of ownership and attachment to the API.

As I [reviewed the Freshbooks API](http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/freshbooks-api-review/ "reviewed the Freshbooks API"), I noticed they have a very community-driven API code samples area.

kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com The Freshbooks API provides client libraries in Ruby, Pythkinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.comipt, Java, .NET, and C++, as well as plug-ins for popular frameworks like Zend, Drupal and Symphony.

Many of the [client libraries and plug-ins](http://developers.freshbooks.com/sample-code/ "client libraries and plug-ins") are built by the Freshbooks API community, such as:

> ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/matt-culbreth.jpg)_Python client libraries by [Matt Culbreth](http://mattculbreth.com/index.html "Matt Culbreth"), a software developer in Marietta, Georgia USA._

By encouraging your API developers to build code samples, plug-ins, and code libraries, you can get necessary tools built for an API. But just as importantly, you're building community and providing a much needed spotlight for your developers. This in turn helps them be successful in their careers.
