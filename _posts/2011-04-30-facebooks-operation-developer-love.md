Facebook has been accused of [not caring about, or communicating](http://www.coreymcmahon.com/facebook/development/5-reasons-developers-hate-the-facebook-platform.html "Facebook Doesn't Care About Its Developers") with its developers, an image that can be hard to shake.

Recently they made a huge effort in turning this around, with a campaign called [Operation Developer Love](http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/495 "Operation Developer Love").

Each week they recap whats happened within the development community and provide some other nuggets of information:

*   Code Samples
*   Forum Activity
*   Bugzilla Activity

This week they also provided an overview of how they are improvingkinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com

They also provide some insight into some developer site latency, and how they've move the site to some new servers and show a graph of significantly improved performance. ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Developer-Site-Latecy.png) Operation Developer Love is a great example of actively trying to engage your API developer community.

I'm impressed by Facebooks efforts to open up and engage.
