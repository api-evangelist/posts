kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-social-coding-words.png)[GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub") is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.

The site also provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and a network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.

Github provides two main tools that can be used in an API area:

*   **[Github Repositories](http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/ "Github Repositories")** - Git code repositories for various supporting areas of an API
*   **[Gists](https://gist.github.com/ "Gists")** - Gist are a simple way to share snippets of code

There are several ways to use Github repositories and Gists in an API area:

*   **Documentation** - Display example calls, requests, and responses using Gists
*   **Code Samples** - Display code samples using Gists, and package up entire sets of code samples using Github repositories
*   **Code Libraries** - Package up official and community generated API code libraries as Github repositories
*   **Prototypes** - Publish API prototypes as Github repositories

![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-round.png) Github provides a way for API owners to manage a large number of code samples, libraries and prototypes, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community.

The social spects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github.

Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.
