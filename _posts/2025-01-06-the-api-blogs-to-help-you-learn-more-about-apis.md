There are just a handful of blogs out there that we recommend for people to learn about the world of APIs from. There are a number of generic sources of information, but the stack of experienced, opinionated, and practical blogs that are regularly posting stories can be fund in this list.

- [Nordic APIs](https://nordicapis.com/)
- [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com/)
- [APIs You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/)
[- EveryDeveloper](https://everydeveloper.com/)
- [APIsecurity.io](https://apisecurity.io/)

These sources of API information are invested directly in the world of APIs, and bring a wealth of experience to the table when it comes to general API knowledge, or specializing in marketing, security, and governance. This is where you want to begin when it comes to learning more about the world of APIs, and receive a steady drip of knowledge from people who know the space.
