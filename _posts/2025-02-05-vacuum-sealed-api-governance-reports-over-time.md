There is a lot to [explore under the hood of Vacuum](https://bit.ly/3WDnhej) as one works to understand how the open-source API governance linting library shifts API governance from 1st gear into 2nd gear, and appears at first glance to give you everything one needs to get out on the freeway and go as fast as you need with your API governance. On feature we find ourselves playing with today is the [report command for Vacuum](https://bit.ly/4hBjl64), which will give you “vacuum-sealed” data for a review of an OpenAPI using Spectral or Vacuum rulesets, with the following benefits.

- **High Fidelity Data** - All the technical details of rules and OpenAPI executive at specific time.
- **Replayable Dataset** - Giving you a snapshot in time that anyone can run to understand review.
- **Results Preservation** - Future runs of an OpenAPI review will not alter the historical runs.
- **Progress Over Time** - Each report gets saved with date and time in name so you can see progress.
- **Dashboards & Reports** - You can view your API governance reviews as reports and in a dashboard.

Vacuum is working on the reporting across each individual run so that you can see API governance reviews over time. We recommend executing these reviews on a regular schedule across all APIs to show how work is progressing over time, always showing the latest report by default for any OpenAPI. Real-time API governance reviews should just be part of the daily fabric of API operations with dashboard and HTML report accessible by team members to help keeping everyone aware and learning of the current state of API governance for the APIs they own, but also keeping everyone learning about each others APIs, as well as governance rules and how they are applied.
