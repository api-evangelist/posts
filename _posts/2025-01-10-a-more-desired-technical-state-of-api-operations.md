The enterprise leadership API Evangelist has been talking to is not asking a lot, they are just looking for some quick ways they can achieve, or at least get closer to a more desired technical state of API operations, giving teams the autonomy and accountability they need, while still steering the ship in the right direction.

  - We Have a Centralized Gateway
  - We Provide Centralized Resources
  - Also Support Federated Gateways
  - We Use More Standards in APIs
  - All APIs Are Observable and Traceable
  - All New APIs Are Being Governed

Everything listed here must be delivered alongside everything else already happening within the enterprise, providing an operational “overlay” for APIs to be rolled out without disrupting existing operations, forcing teams to take on additional work, and will require a centralized, but embedded team to deliver on.

This is part of ongoing series to aggregate all of the conversations we've had with enterprises about their APIs over the last five years into a single outline.
