As I work on creating more useful Postman collections I am distilling my API definitions down to the small possible unit as I possibly can. While I have many robust reference Postman collections and OpenAPIs, I am enjoying creating Postman collections that accomplish just a single ting—representing each digital capability that I have. Currently my digital capabilities are spread across a number of servers, GitHub repositories, and Postman workspaces. If I use one of the APIs in my long list of API providers it is pretty common that I use less than 5% of the API paths from each individual providers. So, other than for sharing as part of my API Evangelist research, why do I need to wade through entire reference API collections to get at the one or two capabilities I need to actually use.

I’m slowly working through the stack of APIs that I use, pulling out the different capabilities I put to work as part of my API Evangelist work, defining as single Postman collections that I list on my GitHub capabilities page. I have published two Twitter API capabilities I have defined, which I will be expanding on pretty quickly, helping document all of the essential API calls I make to the Twitter platform.
