After just a couple months of REST and relaxation, the build up to API Strategy & Practice SF is kicking into gear. We officially [launched the new site for San Francisco last week](http://www.apistrategyconference.com//2013SF/2013/05/31/kicking-of-apistrat-in-san-francisco-october-23-25-2013/), featuring the following speaker:

*   Daniel Jacobson of Netflix
*   David Weekly of Facebook
*   Drew Dillon of Yammer
*   Jeff Atwood of Stack Exchange and Discourse.org
*   Pamela Fox of Coursera
*   Peter Rexer of Box

With the following sponsors stepping up to make sure the API community comes together and shares stories and experiences from the trenches:

APIStrat is shaping up to be twice the event we had in New York City, and it is still June--we still have four months to go! We are working hard to put together the best line up of keynotes, sessions, panels and workshops possible.
