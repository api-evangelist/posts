[Adrian Machado from Zuplo came by for a talk on API rate limiting](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/store/2025-01-30-adrian-machado-zuplo/), but not just the technical bits. Zuplo is doing a good job at bridging the business and technical aspects of rate limiting at the API gateway layer, and we had a compelling discussion around how planning your rate limits will shape your overall API business plan. Adrian provided some compelling thoughts around the need for standardization of API rate limits and how we approach the API access plans and policies we are implementing in regions around the globe. After the gateway layer Adrian shared more about the Zuplo ethos of API documentation should be free with their [Zudoku offering](https://bit.ly/3WHrZI5), something I can definitely get behind.

API Evangelist will be doing more work at this intersection of the technical and business dimension of our gateways. Having an API plan and rate limits is an aspect of doing APIs that has not changed in fifteen years, and doing the work here is how you get a handle on the value delivered as part of each API request and response. More writing is needed at this intersection, and we'll be doing some knowledge building sessions in coming months to help shine a light here. As part of this work we'll do some more playing around with [Zuplo's API gateway](https://bit.ly/4aAzFSd), which aligns with our work well in that they are policy and specification driven, leverage a federated GitOps approach to doing APIs. Thanks Adrian for coming by, looking for to many more in the future.
