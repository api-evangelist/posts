I have been thinking about[Adam Kleinbergs](http://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkleinberg "Adam Kleinberg") recent posts,[Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers](http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/brand-open-api-developers/ "Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers") and[Digging deeper on Brand APIs](http://www.tractionco.com/blog/63-digging-deeper-on-brand-apis "Digging Deeper on Brand APIs").

He's right. The pace of[API development skyrocketed in 2010](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/03/08/3000-web-apis/ "API Development Skyrocketed in 2010"), and will continue in 2011.

Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.

kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com I suggested companies get their feet wet in the API space by starting with a basic [RESTful](http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/) API that servers up data about their products. Then once a company is confident in supporting their API they can consider delivering more supporting product information.

Whats a good next move? Location and Geographic Data. Where can your products be found? Retail and Wholesale. ![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/SimpleGeo.jpg) Provide quality, up to date information about who sells your products. Provide as much detail as you can, names, addresses, specific products and even geographic coordinates.

There are plenty of [geo and mapping API](http://simplegeo.com/ "Geo and Mapping API") resources to provide additional data that enriches your retail and wholesale store information.

Providing rich, real-time location data about products, retails, wholesalers, and partners through an API will enable web and mobile developers to build applications around your company and its products.
