OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is a specification for designing, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. It provides a standard, language-agnostic format that describes APIs, enabling both humans and machines to understand a service's capabilities without accessing its source code. By defining common schema properties, OpenAPI has become the universal language for API descriptions, bridging the gap between business and engineering teams across enterprises.

- **Endpoints and Methods** - Defines HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **Parameters and Responses** - Specifies query parameters, headers, and response formats.
- **Schemas** - Provides reusable data models for request and response payloads.
- **Security Schemes** - Describes authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and API Keys.
- **Tags and Metadata** - Groups related endpoints and adds descriptions for clarity.

While OpenAPI is used in many different aspects of operations it is best known for a handful of common experiences for both API producers and consumers.

- **API Designs** - Define and validate APIs before implementation.
- **API Documentations** - Generate user-friendly documentation that simplifies adoption.
- **API Testing and Mockings** - Simulate API behavior during development.
- **API Client SDK Generations** - Automatically create SDKs for different languages.
- **API Automations** - Enable DevOps practices like CI/CD with automated tests and deployments.

OpenAPI streamlines API design, documentation, testing, and integration with a standardized, machine-readable format. By fostering collaboration, accelerating development, and ensuring consistent, reliable APIs, it has become a foundational tool in the enterprise HTTP API ecosystem. The technical details of any HTTP API should be defined using OpenAPI and further enhanced with OpenAPI overlays throughout the API lifecycle. While OpenAPI focuses on describing individual APIs, its application at scale across an enterprise serves as a comprehensive blueprint of the organization's capabilities.
