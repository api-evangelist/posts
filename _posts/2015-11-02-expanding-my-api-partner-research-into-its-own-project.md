As I explore through API portals, looking for the successful approaches to APIs, I'm increasingly seeing formal partner programs, [resulting in me expanding the topic as its own research area](http://partners.apievangelist.com/index.html). My objective is to keep track of how the APIs I track on operate their partner programs, resulting in the list of organizations I reference in my research. I also want to try and identify what some of the common building blocks of API partner programs are, in addition to the news stories that I have curated about partnerships--which is the fuel of my research.

I have recorded 31 separate partner programs, which I found through the course of my API monitoring and research.

These are all companies who have formal partner efforts that provide a higher level of access to their API. There are many companies who feel their developer programs is a partner program, but what I am looking for is a partner program that looks to certify developers, and give them more benefits through deeper participation with a platform.

After looking through these companies I've recorded a handful of what I'd consider to be some of the common building blocks of these API partner programs.
