A common question we get at API Evangelist about APIs is where one can find training materials on APIs that are high quality. There are a wealth of programming language and technology specific aprpoaches to delivering APIs, but these are the handful of high quality training materials on various levels of API operations that are delivered by experts.

This is an area that API Evangelist is working in 2025 to deliver more solutions. We are working on knowledge bases that possess a lot of the characteristics of online trainings, webinars, and workshops, but in a more hands-on and downloable format. Check back often as we'll be adding more to this list, and further flesh out a section dedicated to our knowledgebases.
