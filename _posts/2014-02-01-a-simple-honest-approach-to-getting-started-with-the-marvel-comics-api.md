I’m currently reviewing the [Marvel Comics API](http://developer.marvel.com/), and their approach to making their rich content available via a simple web API.

They did a great job deploying the API. To start with they published very simple and honest getting started steps:

*   **Sign Up** - Get an API key
*   **Be A Good API Citizen** \- Read, understand, and abide by the terms of use for the Marvel Comics API
*   **Link Back** \- Observe the attribution and linking guidelines when displaying data from the API
*   **Keep In Touch -** Tell us about what you're building and talk to other developers on our community page
*   **Build Cool Stuff!**

I like their style. As a building block, getting started pages are pretty important, yet most API providers provide very dry, technical steps for on-boarding with an API—if at all.

The Marvel Comics API is a refreshing approach to explaining to developers how to get up and running with the API. Its nice to see from such a big brand.
