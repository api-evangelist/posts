Coming on the heels of [API Days Mediterranea in Madrid Spain](/2013/06/04/apidays-mediterranea-is-a-wrap/), is the next event in the series, [API Days San Francisco](http://sf.apidays.io/). We kicked off the API Days event series in Paris, at the end of last year, and now after the momentum in Spain, API Days has picked up enough speed to hop the ocean and land in the heart of technology.

The lineup is pretty rock'n, with talks from [Runscope](http://runscope.com), [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com), [Layer 7 Technologies](http://www.layer7tech.com/), [Netflix](http://netflix.com), [Intel](http://intel.com), [Apigee](http://apigee.com), [DotCloud](https://www.dotcloud.com/), [Stripe](http://stripe.com), [Mashape](http://mashape.com), [Mashery](http://mashery.com), [3Scale](http://3scale.net), [Zapier](http://zapier.com), [APISpark](http://apispark.com), [Singly](http://singly.com), [Salesforce](http://salesforce.com), [SOA Software](http://soa.com), [Apiary.io](http://apiary.io), [Fitbit](http://fitbit.com), [SAP](http://sap.com), [Mulesoft](http://mulesoft.com), [Apiphay](http://apiphany.com), [Webshell](http://webshell.io), [faberNovel](http://www.fabernovel.com/en/), [Reverb](http://helloreverb.com/) and [AngelHack](http://angelhack.com/).

The theme for API Days San Francisco is the API Economy, so it makes sense there are even VC's talking from [True Ventures](http://www.trueventures.com/), [Bessemer Venture Partners](https://www.bvp.com/) and even Alex William from [Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com) will be there.

The headliner is ex-Calvin Klein underwear model, media junkie, stimulator of tech influencers and master of spin Mike Maney ([@the\_spinmd](https://twitter.com/the_spinmd)) of [Maney Digital](http://maneydigital.com/). You can count on the event being a good time with the Spin MD, Mike Maney around.

API Days San Francisco is shaping up to be a pretty kick ass event. I'd make sure you are there. It is downtown SF, this weekend 6/21 and 6/22 at [Parisoma](http://www.parisoma.com/).

I'll be there and look forward to seeing you there!
