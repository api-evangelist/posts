[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/freshbooks-invoice-logo.gif)](http://www.freshbooks.com/ "Freshbooks")[Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/ "Freshbooks") provides time tracking, expense and invoicing Software as a Service (SaaS).

The [Freshbooks API](http://developers.freshbooks.com/ "Freshbooks API") is a RESTful API, using OAuth for authentication. The API provides sixteen endpoints, providing the same functionality through the API, as whats available through the web application.

The Freshbook API community provides Ruby, Python, PHP, CakePHP, Perl, JavaScript, ActionScript, Java, and .NET sample code libraries.
