Its official, the next edition of [API Strategy will be in Chicago, September 24,25, and 26th 2014](http://apistrategyconference.com/). We've dubbed this version of the conference, '**_APIs Going Mainstream_**'!

As APIs make their way into almost every business sector imaginable, we thought it would make sense to have an API conversation with some of the top brands, in the heartland of the United States--Chicago.

We are kicking things off with six speakers:
