2011 was an interesting year for APIs. I wasn't as good as I wanted to be at covering all major API events, but I got some traction with some posts I didn't anticipate.

Here are my top 10 traffic posts on API Evangelist for 2011:

*   [**Apple iCloud API**](http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/06/apple-icloud-api/)
*   ****[Considerations When Planning Endpoints for your RESTful API](http://apievangelist.com/2011/10/18/considerations-when-planning-endpoints-for-your-restful-api/ "Considerations When Planning Endpoints for your RESTful API")****
*   ******[Google Launches OAuth 2.0 Playground](http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/08/google-launches-oauth-2.0-playground/ "Google Launches OAuth Playground")******
*   ********[iCloud Storage APIs](http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/08/icloud-storage-apis/ "iCloud Storage APIs")********

*   ************[Open Building Blocks for an API](http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/ "Open Building Blocks for an API")  
    ************
*   ****************[Providing Code Libraries is Not Enough for Your API](http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/17/providing-code-libraries-is-not-enough-for-your-api/ "Providing Code Libraries is not Enough")****************
*   ******************[RESTful Business Architecture](http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/ "RESTful Business Architecture")******************

I expected Apple related API stories to be big, but the other topics on here like endpoint planning, transit APIs, open building blocks, RESTful business architecture and a flood of APIs were a surprise.

Overall it shows me that applying APIs and RESTful concepts to business in specific industries can really get people talking.

A few of these posts were written while I was doing deep dives into government, water and transit industries and how APIs are changing the landscape.

I hope to do many of these deep industry dives in 2012.
