The state of teams producing and consuming APIs across the enterprise is almost always fragmented, competitive, and political, and when this is the foundation for producing external APIs that power a companyâ€™s applications, is given to partners, or made available via public portal, it can become a problem.

  - Many Different Business Siloes
  - Many Different Teams Involved
  - A Wide Mix of Incentives for APIs
  - Teams Lacking the Skills Needed
  - Teams Lacking Resources Required
  - Little Communication Between Teams

The presence or lack of presence for the public API portal of any enterprise is a reflection of the internal people who are doing the work to produce and support HTTP APIs, and ensuring that teams have the skills and resources they need to be successful will require significant time and investment over many years.
