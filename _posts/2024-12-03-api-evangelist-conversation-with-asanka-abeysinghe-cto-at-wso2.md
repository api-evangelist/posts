[Asanka Abeysinghe, CTO at WSO2 came by for a conversation](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/sessions/2024-12-03-asanka-abeysinghe.html) about the realities on the ground within enterprises when it comes to the platformication of all things, from Internet Developer Portals (IDP) to API platforms. Asanka has been at this game for a while, and he and I have been discussing the realities of API management for years now, and we share a lot of the same views when it comes to the expansion and evolution of our space. But, more specifically how do we keep providing what is needed on the ground for teams, no matter what vendor sales cycle or trend we might find ourselves in.

Now that I have a better understanding of what I will be offering as a service in the world of APIs in 2025 I am easing up my restrictions on having API service providers by for a conversation, and what better way than to invite old friends to share their views. Asanka is a veteran in this game and while he is hustling WSO2's products and services, he also is having conversations with people on the ground regularly, and is more than happy to come challenge me on my assumptions about what is going on -- so happy to have him back anytime. 

I'd like to have him back to poke at the internal developer portal thing more, but also more about where platforms are falling short when it comes to delivering the change we have been promising for a couple years now. Always good to have you Asanka, and look forward to having you back.
