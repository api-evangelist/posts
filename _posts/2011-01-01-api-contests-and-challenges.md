In 2010 contests were a proven way to generate attention about your API and products as well as generate some great code and applications for your API.

Some contests in 2010 were:

*   [AWS Start-up Challenge](http://aws.amazon.com/startupchallenge)
*   [Bit.ly API Contest](http://blog.bit.ly/post/1307062006/its-a-bit-ly-api-contest)
*   [Etsy Handmade Code Contest]( http://www.programmableweb.com/contests)

*   [Twilio Netbook Mondays](http://contests.twilio.com/)
*   [World Bank Apps for Development](http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com/)

All these contests are finished now, except for the World Bank Apps for Development which is still running for another week.
