While interviewing over a hundred people on my [Breaking Changes podcast](https://apievangelist.com/videos/), the lack of alignment between business and technical groups while delivering and iterating upon APIs was the number one source of friction across enterprise organizations. While API governance is an essential aspect of it, <a href="https://developer.visa.com/pages/working-with-visa-apis">ensuring that your API program speaks to business people as well as developers like Visa is doing</a>, is what this phase of the API journey is all about.

I am taking note of the building blocks Visa provides as part of the business getting started menu, as well as the building blocks on the developer side of the coinâ€”you should too. The secret here is that it doesn't just have a section for developers and business people, it is the alignment established when your team produces the content and process to support both sides of this coin. This is the work that has to happen on the ground across the enterprise if you are going to make an impact.
