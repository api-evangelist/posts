Google has partnered with [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.com "TRUSTe") to offer [Data Privacy Certification for Google Apps Marketplace Apps](http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2011/05/truste-data-privacy-certification-now.html "Data Privacy Certification for Google Apps Marketplace Apps").

The [certification program](http://www.truste.com/google-apps/ "certification program") assists vendors of installable apps better communicate their data privacy and handling practices to Google Apps users.

Installable Google Apps that become certified will have the TRUSTe logo displayed on their marketplace page, as well as in search and category results listing pages.

If a Google Apps customers wants to see more details, they can click on the TRUSTe logo to view a privacy policy report, hosted on TRUSTe.com.

All installable Marketplace apps have the option to apply for the free certification for the first year, and can choose to renew at $300 per year per app for each year after.

You can find full details of the program on [TRUSTe's certification FAQ page](http://www.truste.com/google-apps/certification-faq.php "TRUSTe Certification Page").

AS more APIs deploy [self-service application directories and marketplaces](http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/ "self-service application directories and marketplaces"), data privacy will become a major concern, its good to see TRUSTe has a certification program.
