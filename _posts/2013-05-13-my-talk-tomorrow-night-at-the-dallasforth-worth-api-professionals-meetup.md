After looking through the list of folks who have RSVP'd for the [DFW API Professionals Meetup in Dallas tomorrow night](http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/), it looks like an interesting mix of tech and business folk. The tech group is definitely the larger, with a mix of mobile, web and enterprise. The business folks look like a mix of VC, project manager, marketing and startups.

I'm heading out to Dallas in the morning, and I am spending my afternoon preparing my talk. When it comes to meetups, I like to wait until the last moment, see who has RSVP'd and shift my talk to being more tech, more business or more API 101 depending on the audience. I like the mix of people I'm seeing RSVP'd for tomorrow night.

I'm pulling together a talk from some of my regular material, but updating for what is going on right now. Resulting in the following outline I'm calling, "From ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld":

As with all of my talks, I look forward to making it a conversation with the audience and hopefully shifting the discussion, further towards what Dallas-Forth worth folks are looking to understand and share within the API space.

Thanks to [theRightAPI](http://www.therightapi.com/) for pulling the event together and [Proxomo](http://www.proxomo.com/ "BAaS"), [Layer 7 Technologies](http://www.layer7tech.com/ "API Management") and [Pariveda Solutions](http://www.parivedasolutions.com/ "Tech Efficiency and Innovation") for sponsoring to make it all possible. I look forward to seeing you all in Dallas, TX tomorrow evening.
