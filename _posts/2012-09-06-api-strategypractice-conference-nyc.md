The API industry has come of age in 2012. [ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com "ProgrammableWeb") has rolled over 7000 public APIs available, [President Obama has mandated that all federal departments and agencies deploy APIs](http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/ "President Obama has mandated that all federal departments and agencies deploy APIs"), and there are now two major, enterprise quality open-source API management solutions available.

The industry is ready for its own, vendor neutral event where all API service providers and API owners can come together and discuss both the business and technical side of API design, deployment and management.

With this in mind, Iâ€™d like to announce the **[API Strategy & Practice Conference](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/ "API Strategy & Practice Conference")**, in New York City, on November 1st and 2nd 2012.

Whether you already have API or are looking to better understand the strategy and best practices around API management, this is an event for you.

API Strategy & Practice ([#apistrat](https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23apistrat "#apistrat")) is featuring talks from John Musser of ProgrammableWeb, Daniel Jacobson of Netflix, Laura Merling of Alcatel-Lucent, John Sheehan of IFTT with more speakers to come.

The event is happening because of support from our sponsors:
