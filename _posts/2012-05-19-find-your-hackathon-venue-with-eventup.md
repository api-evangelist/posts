I am going through all my notes from organizing the [CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon](http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/citygrid-hackathon-los-angeles-is-a-wrap/ "CityGrid Los angeles Hackathon") and trying to publish as many stories as I can, about how I planned and organized the hackathon.

One service that was a catalyst for the event occuring, was assistance from [EventUp](http://eventup.com/ "EventUp"). EventUp is a service that assists event venue owners in finding people to rent their space, and in turn can help you find the ideal location for your hackathon. 

Tony Adam ([@tonyadam](https://twitter.com/#!/tonyadam "@tonyadam")) the owner of EventUp emailed me one day after I had submitted a request via eventup.com for more information on venues for my Hackathon in the Los Angeles area. He offered to help make sure I found the right location.

After a couple days he helped me secure [CoLoft](http://www.coloft.com/) which was the best location for the hackathon imaginable. It was accessible, had great layout with tables, good wifi and the staff was extremely helpful.

[EventUp](http://eventup.com/ "EventUp") isn’t in all markets yet, but if you’re planning a hackathon I recommend talking with Tony at Eventup, and seeing if they have the right location for your event.
