Three months after the [White House CIO mandated that all federal departments and agencies have a digital strategy](/federal_government.php "White House CIO mandated that all federal departments and agencies have a digital strategy"), we are getting closer to having access to some high value APIs, across almost twenty participating departments and agencies.

Up to now, it is just a lot of talk about strategy, without much detail on what will be deployed.  Now that there are [20 digital strategies published](/admin/blog/White House CIO mandated that all federal departments and agencies have a digital strategy "20 digital strategies published"), we can start seeing some of the APIs the departments and agencies will be deploying in the coming months.

Here is a list of "systems" that each participating department or agency will be deploying:

I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get excited about the potential here. With almost 20 departments and agencies on board, and 166 APIs planned--there is a lot of potential for the other 226 departments and agencies to see the potential and get on board.

This list of systems are generated programmatically using each department or agencies machine readable digital strategy. I didn't have to compile this by hand, which shows the potential of the digital strategy to become a federal API discovery platform.  You can view the [real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy](/federal_government_digital_strategy_systems.php "real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy"), which gets updated every night when I run my monitoring script.
