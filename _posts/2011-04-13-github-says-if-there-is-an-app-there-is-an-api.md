Github launched some[enhancements to its GitHub Jobs homepage](https://github.com/blog/836-github-jobs-update "enhancements to its Github Jobs homepage"), and IPhone application.

Being the forward thinkers they are, they say:

> _If there's an app there's an API, so we've made ours available to everyone..._

The [GitHub Jobs API](http://jobs.github.com/api "GitHub Jobs API") allows you to search, view, and create jobs with JSON over HTTP.

The APIalso provides support for JSONP, by appending ?callback=myFunction to any API request, it will wrap the response in a function call to myFunction. This is useful when making requests to the GitHub Jobs API using JavaScript.

Nothing to revolutionary, or noteworthy about the API, except Github is just way cool, and I love their perspective that, if there is an app there is an API.
