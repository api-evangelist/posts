I have done several dives into the world of GraphQL. As part of some API specification work I am not getting another chance to look at what the open source community around GraphQL looks like. Along with other API specifications in our modern API toolbox, I am looking at how GraphQL is being leverage, and what the motivations are behind the open source tooling that has emerged. Resulting in the following list of the cream off the top of the open source tooling build on top of GraphQL, broken down by different stops along the API lifecycle.

Similar to my snapshots of OpenAPI, Swagger, Postman, and gRPC, I think that GraphQL paints an interesting picture. Of course, this is just a look at what open source is available on GitHub, but it still provides an interesting look at what is important to GraphQL providers and consumers. I am going to keep making my way through each dimension of the API specification landscape, identifying the top tooling that exists. Once I get through it all I will do more side by side comparison of what is going on, looking for the challenges and opportunities when it comes to open source tooling as part of a diverse API toolbox.
