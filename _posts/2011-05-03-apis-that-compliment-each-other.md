[![](http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Rdio-Logo-Gradient.png)](http://rdio.com)I'm starting to see more API providers working together to attract developers to their platforms.

As an API Evangelist I look for other APIs that enhance the [Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API](http://developer.mimeo.com "Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API"), and try to figure out how I can leverage this, or at least tell the story.

[Google Cloud Print Services Interface](http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/ "Google Cloud Print Services Interface") and the [creating classroom training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect](hkinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.comave been two of my favorites so far. I also just finished a blog post about <a title= "Box.net").

Today I saw that[Rdio](http://rdio.com), the social music service [announce their partnership](http://blog.rdio.com/post/5161479190/announcing-rdios-partnership-with-the-echo-nest "announce their partnership") with [The Echo Nest](http://the.echonest.com/ "The Echo Nest"), a music intelligence platform.

They are partnering behind the scenes, but I'm sure the API is the driving force behind this relationship.[![](http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/the-echo-nest.gif)](http://the.echonest.com/ "The Echo Nest")

APIs enable new types of partnerships, and even allow API providers to work together and offer a more collective value.

What other APIs do you think compliment each other, and should consider partnering?
