I was pleased to see the good folks over at [Bump.sh](https://bump.sh/) have adopted [APIs.json](https://apisjson.org/) as the discovery format for their API documentation hubs. They have a nice write-up on how to [Make your APIs Discoverable with APIs.json](https://bump.sh/blog/make-your-apis-discoverable-with-apis-json), walking through how APIs.json works and how it is automatically generated as part of your API documentation hub. The article is written by Phil Sturgeon, which I am thankful for Bump convincing Phil to step away from tree planting for a few to showcase their use of my API discovery format.

Bump.sh is one of the innovators remaining in the API space that I met while working at Postman, and happy to see that they keep running a useful API service and not fall prey to the investment pressures of the API realm. Few companies have the vision and expertise to navigate these waters, and it makes me happy that Bump is doing something well—-which is what this is all about. Bump.sh has focused on the intersection of documentation, discovery, and change across a diverse API toolbox by supporting OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, and SOAP—-something that reflects the reality on the ground of enterprises.

I am **EXTREMELY** picky about who I write about on API Evangelist these days. You won’t find me endorsing any startup, but Bump.sh has found one of just a handful of routes to my heart, and the publish button here on API Evangelist—-supporting APIs.json. Well, that and providing a useful, honest, and easy to use API solution that solves an actual pain point we all have. I would say that Bump.sh reflects what I like to see in an API service provider these days, by focusing on a meaningful intersection of problems API producers or consumers face, supporting open source API specifications, and offering a free, but also paid service-s—basically running a real API business, not just a startup hustle.

If you are looking for a modern [API documentation](https://bump.sh/api-documentation), [discovery](https://bump.sh/api-catalog), and [change management](https://bump.sh/api-change-management) solution across the leading API protocols and patterns, I recommend taking a look at what Bump.sh is up to. I am going to dig more into their services and how they help API producers, keeping an eye out for their customers who have a published APIs.json, but also better understanding how the building blocks they offer can be better represented as APIs.json properties. Things like change log, road map, and other elements. As I work to refine the search engine behind APIs.io, these operational elements are what matters most, and I will be looking to continue showcasing usage of APIs.json, but also maximizing API services that are expressed as machine-readable APIs.json properties.
