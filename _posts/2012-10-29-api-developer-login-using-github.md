As with most social platforms, [Github](https://github.com/) provides oAuth for their platform, allowing developers to provide secure credentials and authentication for their users via a Github account.

Service providers like [Singly](https://singly.com/ "Singly") are providing two click authentication using Github's oAuth. This allows any website or app to offer their users the ability to login with their Github profile.

Allowing authentication via Github is no brainer for API providers. Why require users to create yet another login, or even use [Twitter](https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter) or [Facebook](https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook) oAuth? Allow them to login and retrieve API keys via the one social profile that reflects the programmer side of their online profile.

Github login can be implemented in any programming language, and because it is oAuth, it is something end users will understand. In addition to providing easy authentication, you will be able to immediately see other important data about a developer that is available via their Github profile.

Consider the potential of using Github authentication as part of your API strategy.
