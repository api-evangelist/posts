I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my travel in 2015, and focus on some important research, coding, and writing. I apologize to all the events I’ve said no to over the last couple months, but I hit a wall last year with speaking, and trying hard to make 2015 a much more healthier, and balanced year.

With that said, here is where you can find me this spring. I have three places you can find me in April and May:

*   **Berlin, Germany** - You can find me in Berlin, putting on [@APIDays / @APIStrat, April 24th & 25th](http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/)
*   **Barcelona, Catalonia** - I will be speaking at [APIDays Mediterranea, May 6th & 7th, in Barcelona](http://mediterranea.apidays.io/)
*   **Broomfield, CO**
    *   [@APIStrat Tech Un-Workshops @ Gluecon May 19th](http://apistrat.com/2nd-annual-api-strategy-practice-tech-un-workshops-gluecon-2015/) (1:00-5:00 PM)
    *   Leading the Swagger conversation at [Swagger API Meetup @ Gluecon May 19th](http://www.meetup.com/Swagger-API/events/221572540/) (7:00-9:00 PM)
    *   Gluecon - I will be at [Gluecon 2015, May 20th, and 21st, speaking](http://gluecon.com/)

That is all the speaking I’m doing this spring, with one tentative date early in June at BYU. I won’t be traveling again until the fall, when we do @APIStrat again, and of course @DefragCon!

I’m excited to be in Berlin and Barcelona, two of my favorite European cities, and of course Broomfield, CO (specifically the Taproom). I am also excited to not be traveling as much, and able to focus on my wider research, coding, and writing. #thanks
