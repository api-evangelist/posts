I finished updating the [speaker lineup](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php "speaker linup") for the [API Strategy & Practice Conference](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/ "API Strategy & Practice Conference") this weekend. While we still have a couple of panels to finalize and keynotes to announce, the speaker lineup is almost final.

We have spent almost 8 weeks reaching out to leaders across the API industry, soliciting submissions for keynotes, panels and sessions. It has been a lot of fun taking all the submissions and crafting the most compelling schedule as possible.

It was really important to me that we didn’t just discuss the common areas of the API industry, like service providers, REST, etc. Not that these aren’t relevant--they are! But I wanted to make sure we discuss some areas that are critical to the space, but do not get much airtime. Topics like API design and API life-cycle methodologies.

I feel it is also critical to discuss where we are going, by covering topics like API automation, aggregation and building of programming frameworks on top of numerous APIs--trends that will allow us leap forward in how we consume and build apps on top of APIs.

In the next two weeks I will be going through our lineup in detail and talking about the various API session tracks like music, social, payments, government and education to name a few prominent session areas.

While I started getting excited about this event back in August, it is really starting to get real. I’m really psyched about how this event has come together. There will only be 250-300 people at the event, so it’s going to be a very intimate opportunity for network with these API industry leaders.

Make sure and [register for the API Strategy & Practice Conference](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php "register for the API Strategy & Practice Conference") ASAP, and I look forward to seeing you there.
