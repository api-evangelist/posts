Despite the promise of connectivity and interoperability, technology and APIs have tended to separate us into ideological camps of business and engineering, by programming language, and any other tribal boundary you find in todayâ€™s enterprise, leaving a fairly sad state of knowledge and expertise being shared.

  - A Minimum Centralized API Presence
  - No Publicly Available API Presence
  - No Common API Vocabulary
  - No Shared API Workspaces
  - No Source of Truth For APIs
  - Little Sharing of Knowledge Across Teams

Business, human, and technological nutrients are what gets passed around when communities arise around the production and consumption of APIs. APIs require the humans to discover, connect, and leave a trail of knowledge for those who come after, and without it, the enterprise can be left in a pretty bad state of non-collaboration.

This is part of ongoing series to aggregate all of the conversations we've had with enterprises about their APIs over the last five years into a single outline. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the downloadable API governance products we are developing, please <a href="https://apievangelist.com/contact">reach out</a>, and you can read the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-api-evangelist-speaks-being-change-agent-within-enterprise-lane-lmuse">full post on LinkedIn</a>.
