  description: API development is a topic very close to Phil's heart. APIs You Won't Hate started out as a book, with Phil pouring everything API related he knew, all the problems he faced, all the design decisions he wish he thought about earlier. Since the book, Phil has continued to learn and grow, thanks to new experiences, and new conversations with really smart people. Learning never stops, and the Slack channel that grew from the book subscribers and their friends has become home to the largest API chat group on the internet.

What I call the API bubble has value but is limited in the scope of opinions and focuses mostly on what API vendors have to offer.
