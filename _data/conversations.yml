    This is the second pilot for the new API Evangelist Conversations podcast.
    This is an off the record edition where I interview my alter ego Tim Lane,
    but obfuscate my voice and hide my face. Like the first one, it isn't that
    smooth as it is awkward to interview yourself, but I am also just getting
    started with all the production around this series.

    little robotic and awkward as I interview myself, but something that will
    get more natural once I am talking to other human beings.

    This is the first actual edition of the API Evangelist Conversation podcast
    with my friend Pat Patterson, the Chief Technical Evangelist at Backblaze.
    Always enjoy learning from Pat as we dove into the meaning behind his title,
    as well as how Backblaze has standardized their API around the Amazon S3
    storage API--essentially treating the API as the industry standard for
    storage.

    A very focused conversation on change management and versioning with
    Stanislav Zmiev, Tech Lead of Platform Engineering at invoicing  and bill

    Leader at Breeze Strategy about the business and product manager view of the
    API landscape. I am eager to hear from veteran API product managers like
    Dale about how we convince leadership to invest in APIs, but also API
    product managers. Dale has a healthy view of the business of APIs, and how
    this applies across the many different types of APIs we produce and
    consume--which is something we need more of in the API world to help balance
    our heavy focus on the technology of APIs over the last decade.

    to actually get him on the show. Robert and are in alignment on where most
    of the deficiencies exist across the API space and I'd that we both share
    higher technological morals about what makes good APIs and what contributes

    Jamie and I connected on the API's You Won't Hate Slack channel, where I

    more specifically why you should start the version for your API at 0.1.0
    instead of 1.0.0, I knew I needed to have him come for a conversation. I
    really enjoyed Jamie's calm and pragmatic approach to what web APIs are,
    what Semantic Versioning is, and how versioning and change management can
    really help us enable both API producers and consumers to stay aligned.

    Conversation. Subu was one of the accumulated driving forces that pushed me
    towards a focus on API governance after our Breaking Changes episode in
    2022. So I was happy to have him back to learn more about their API journey.
    Subu is always pragmatic, seeing the technology, business, and people of
    APIs equally, which I find to be a rare skill in the world of APIs. So, I
    enjoyed learning about Subu's push into financial optimization and focus on
    what Citrix's customers are needing--which is a shift I am seeing beyond
    just Citrix, and something that is unfolding across many enterprises as they
    look to do more with fewer resources.

    I've been a follower of his work for well over a decade. He provided his
    obligatory plug for Adobe APIs he is an advocate for, but what is really
    motivating him was his new work at the intersection of API and AI. I don't
    have the time and budget to go to deep on AI, so I enjoy learning from
    someone who is as curious and pragmatic as I am about new technologies, a
    conversation that left me with some ideas of how I am going to use not just
    ChatGPT, but also Google Gemini for some of the API profiling work I am
    doing.

    appreciate Ian's honesty in his own struggles with addiction and trying to
    find balance, and wanted to learn more about why he left Postman, and why he
    said he was leaving tech. I don't see Ian as leaving tech, I think he'll
    continue to help us all find our way, and be there for anyone who hits the
    wall or drives into the ditch, as most everyone will experience at one time
    or another. I always cherished Ian's energy, and think this is the perfect

    meet the needs around specific experiences, which may or may not be better
    addressed with overlays. It is all a very fascinating and ever evolving

    applied as part of producer or consumer driven SDK generation using Kiota.
    Vincent shared all kinds of experience and wisdom at this intersection, but
    he also shared a pragmatic view of the role APIs, specs, and integrations
    play when it comes to training LLMs, but also feeding agents deployed on top
    of those LLMs with the real-time resources and capabilities they will need.

    Daniel Kocot came by again to talk about the lines between our private and
    public APIs. We had been talking about internal, first-party, and
    third-party APIs back and forth on LinkedIn, and I recommended that he come
    by and we will have a conversation. He helped me realize that my separation
    between the layers was more about access, control, and velocity over just
    about being inside or outside the firewall and DMZ. Daniel sees this for
    what it is--it is about people. Lines of business, teams, tribes, and
    partners. Daniel has that very outside-in view of API operations, but
    Codecentric is being brought inside to solve the big  problems for their
    customers. Talking with Daniel makes me realize how important it is to have
    these conversations about our APIs and portals, because not everyone has a
    handle on the nuance of what is happening at the edge of our enterprises.

    API Evangelist Conversation with Dave Shanley of Princess Beef Heavy
    Industries
  description: >-
    Quobix from from Princess Beef Heavy Industries came by again, this time to
    talk about OpenAPI Doctor and libopenapi at it's core. I knew "The Doctor"
    was a modular OpenAPI editor w/ governance built-in, but I didn't realize
    how deeply modularity is baked into it's design. This modularity allows
    Quobix to stitch together Vacuum, libopenapi, OpenAPI changes, wiretap, and
    other Princess Beef Heavy Industries solutions, but also potentially other
    3rd party solutions. This modularity in API hubs, dashboards, and tools is
    fast becoming a common themes in conversations that I am having, and
    something I am going to work to leverage more as part of my work. This
    episode went 30 minutes because I wanted to do two separate episoides, 1)
    OpenAPI, 2) libopenapi, but the stories are so entertwhined we just did it
    back to back.

    API Evangelist Conversation About Nothing Changing in the World of APIs with
    Jennifer Riggins
  description: >-
    Tech storyteller and journalist Jennifer Riggins came by for a conversation
    about why nothing has changed in the world of APIs for the last fifteen
    years. Jennifer and I go all the way back to the beginning, and she has seen
    all the same things I've seen. We complained a bit about the impacts of AI,
    but really that most of the lack of change has been a business thing and not
    really just technical. I like Jennifer's focus on developers in this moment,
    and she got me thinking about the relationship between the legacy API
    management we both have lived through and this new platform reality we
    operate within. I always enjoy sitting down with Jennifer, and it has been
    way too long, appreciate you coming by to share some wisdom around why
    things aren't as progressive as they could be in the API space.

    API Evangelist Conversation About Trains, AI, Rich Fat Cats, Big Money, and
    Politics with Adron Hall
  description: >-
    Adron Hall came by for a conversation about trains. Adron and I share a love
    of transit and trains, who also make their living slinging APIs. Adron had
    recommended I read Nothing Like It in the World by Stephen E Ambrose and
    Empire Express by David Haward Bain back a couple of years ago, which I
    finally did. Then things kept happening with AI and the current presidency
    that kept reminding me of the stories in these books and I kepting thinking
    it would be fun to have Adron come by to share his view of things. I won't
    spoil any of his great stories, but both books and Adron's view of them, as
    well as his ability to apply in this moment is gold. Adron is a great
    storyteller and he gets the technology, but he also the business and
    politics of technology in a way few do, making for a very entertaining 30
    minutes.

    API Evangelist Conversation With Frank Kilcommins About the OpenAPI Arazzo
    Specification
  description: >-
    Frank Kilcommins of SmartBear came by to talk about the OpenAPI Arazzo
    specification. He shared the history how it came to be and how it is
    changing the conversation inside and outside the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI).
    Franks done amazing work to move the API workflows specification over the
    finish line, but also keep it evolving and moving forward afterwards. The
    specification has renewed energy with API service providers who are
    integrating the spec into their API guided walkthroughs, SDK generation, and
    testing. I am a big fan of Frank's work, and wish we had 10 more of him
    working at the OpenAPI, so if you are feeling like you have some spare
    cycles, I recommend you rolling up your sleeves and getting involved. Thanks
    for coming by and sharing Frank!!
