          <p>I am perpetually captivated by how APIs have evolved over time. Since I began discussing APIs, I've often heard that their origins predate the timelines I mention in my historical narratives or blog posts. Honestly, if we view "application" as the act of applying a concept or resource, then APIs can be traced back as far as African drumming circles. Every once in a while, I feel compelled to revisit this narrative, and this page reflects what I currently consider to be the API timeline.</p>

          {% include timeline-api.html %}
          
          <p>I am also exploring another perspective on this landscape with [my resource timeline to look at API providers by the digital resources they provide](https://apievangelist.com/timeline-resource/). Additionally, I have started studying the early regulation of industries such as railroads, telecommunications, electricity, and radioâ€”[creating a timeline to help me understand how regulation unfolded for these industries](https://apievangelist.com/timeline-industry/), and why we pushed it forward.</p>
